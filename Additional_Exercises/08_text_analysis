All statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K other than statements\\nof historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans, and our objectives for\\nfuture  operations,  are  forward-looking  statements.  The  words  \"believe,\"  \"may,\"  \"will,\"  \"estimate,\"  \"continue,\"  \"anticipate,\"  \"intend,\"  \"expect,\"  and  similar\\nexpressions  are  intended  to  identify  forward-looking  statements.  We  have  based  these  forward-looking  statements  largely  on  our  current  expectations  and\\nprojections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term\\nbusiness  operations  and  objectives,  and  financial  needs.  These  forward-looking  statements  are  subject  to  a  number  of  risks,  uncertainties  and  assumptions,\\nincluding those described in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing\\nenvironment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our\\nbusiness or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking\\nstatements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not\\noccur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.\\nWe undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Given\\nthese risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\\nUnless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms \"Facebook,\" \"company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" and \"our\" in this document refer to Facebook,\\nInc., a Delaware corporation, and, where appropriate, its subsidiaries. The term \"Facebook\" may also refer to our products, regardless of the manner in which they\\nare  accessed.  The  term  \"Family\"  refers  to  our  Facebook,  Instagram,  Messenger,  and  WhatsApp  products.

We have historically reported the\\nnumbers of our daily active users (DAUs), monthly active users (MAUs), and average revenue per user (ARPU) (collectively, our \"Facebook metrics\") based on\\nuser activity only on Facebook and Messenger and not on our other products. Beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\\n2019, we also report our estimates of the numbers of our daily active people (DAP), monthly active people (MAP), and average revenue per person (ARPP)\\n(collectively, our \"Family metrics\") based on the activity of users who visited at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp (collectively, our\\n\"Family\" of products) during the applicable period of measurement. We believe our Family metrics better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many\\npeople are using more than one of our products. As a result, over time we intend to report our Family metrics as key metrics in place of DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU\\nin our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\nWhile these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent\\nchallenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics\\nrequire significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our\\nuser base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics,\\nand from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical\\nmetrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for\\nsuch adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error\\nmargins disclosed below.\\nIn addition, our Facebook metrics and Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology.\\nFacebook Metrics\\nWe regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \"duplicate\" and \"false\" accounts among our MAUs. A duplicate account is one that a\\nuser maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide \"false\" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created\\npersonal profiles for a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a Page rather than a personal profile\\nunder our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of\\nservice, such as bots and spam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply\\nsignificant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar user\\nnames, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. Any loss of access to\\ndata signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative\\nrequirements, limitations while our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our\\nestimates of duplicate and false accounts. Our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or\\ntechnologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader\\npopulation of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false\\naccounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our worldwide MAUs. We believe the\\npercentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. In\\nthe fourth quarter of 2020, we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately 5% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts can\\nvary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as Indonesia and\\nVietnam. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts\\namong our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate and\\nfalse accounts among our MAUs on an annual basis.\\n4\\nTable of Contents\\nThe numbers of DAUs and MAUs discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as ARPU, do not include users on Instagram, WhatsApp, or our\\nother products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook.\\nFamily Metrics\\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual\\nproduct. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not\\nreflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook,\\nInstagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\\ntherefore  must  seek  to  attribute  multiple  user  accounts  within  and  across  products  to  individual  people.  To  calculate  these  metrics,  we  rely  upon  complex\\ntechniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accounts\\nwithin an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one\\nperson. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject to statistical\\nvariances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While\\nwe  expect  the  error  margin  for  our  Family  metrics  to  vary  from  period  to  period,  we  estimate  that  such  margin  generally  will  be  approximately  4%  of  our\\nworldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the\\nactual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is\\nalso possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of\\nlimited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates.\\nFor example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses,\\nand user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which are inherently\\nsubject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family\\nmetrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our\\nFamily metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some\\nproducts compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and\\nprimarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although Messenger\\nKids users are included in our Family metrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating DAP and\\nMAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-\\nparty browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, limitations while our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other\\nfactors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve,\\nincluding through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning\\nthat may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution\\nmay allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \"violating\" accounts. We define \"violating\" accounts\\nas accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we\\nestimated that approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample\\nof  accounts,  and  we  apply  significant  judgment  in  making  this  determination.  For  example,  we  look  for  account  information  and  behaviors  associated  with\\nFacebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In\\naddition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we\\nbelieve they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other\\nactions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to\\ndisclose our estimates of the percentage of our MAP consisting solely\\n5\\nTable of Contents\\nof violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts\\nmay vary significantly from our estimates.\\nThe numbers of Family DAP and MAP discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as ARPP, do not include users on our other products, unless\\nthey would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other activities on our Family products.\\nUser Geography\\nOur data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user\\'s IP address and self-disclosed location.\\nThese factors may not always accurately reflect the user\\'s actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy\\nserver that the user connects to rather than from the user\\'s actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other\\ntechnical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.\\n6\\nTable of Contents\\nPART I\\nItem 1. Business\\nOverview\\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\\nWe build useful and engaging products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual\\nreality headsets, and in-home devices. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world around them, enable people to share their\\nopinions, ideas, photos and videos, and other activities with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay\\nconnected everywhere by accessing our products, including:\\n•\\nFacebook. Facebook enables people to connect, share, discover, and communicate with each other on mobile devices and personal computers. There\\nare a number of different ways to engage with people on Facebook and build community, including Facebook News Feed, Stories, Groups, Shops,\\nMarketplace, News, and Watch.\\n•\\nInstagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. It is a place where people can express themselves through photos,\\nvideos, and private messaging, and connect with and shop from their favorite businesses and creators. They can do this through Instagram Feed,\\nStories, Reels, IGTV, Live, Shops, and messaging.\\n•\\nMessenger. Messenger  is  a  simple  yet  powerful  messaging  application  for  people  to  connect  with  friends,  family,  groups,  and  businesses  across\\nplatforms and devices through chat, video, and Rooms.\\n•\\nWhatsApp. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and businesses around the world to communicate\\nand transact in a private way.\\n•\\nFacebook Reality Labs. Facebook Reality Labs\\' augmented and virtual reality products help people feel connected, anytime, anywhere. Oculus Quest\\nlets people defy distance with cutting-edge virtual reality (VR) hardware, software, and content, while Portal helps friends and families stay connected\\nand share the moments that matter in meaningful ways.\\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements to marketers. Our ads enable marketers to reach people based on a variety\\nof factors including age, gender, location, interests, and behaviors. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram,\\nMessenger, and third-party applications and websites.\\nCompetition\\nOur  business  is  characterized  by  innovation,  rapid  change,  and  disruptive  technologies.  We  compete  with  companies  providing  connection  and\\ncommunication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and\\nsystems  for  managing  and  optimizing  advertising  campaigns.  We  face  significant  competition  in  every  aspect  of  our  business,  including,  but  not  limited  to,\\ncompanies that facilitate the ability of users to share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or\\nprospective audiences, including, for example, Google, Apple, YouTube, Tencent, Snap, Twitter, ByteDance, Microsoft, and Amazon. We compete to attract,\\nengage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain\\ndevelopers to build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer\\nhardware and virtual reality products and services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new\\nproducts and services, we may become subject to additional competition.\\n7\\nTable of Contents\\nTechnology\\nOur product development philosophy is centered on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design, which means that\\nour products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with products\\nlike video and VR increases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies like artificial intelligence, our computing needs continue to expand. We make\\nsignificant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones, as well as for our marketers and developers. We\\nare also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against\\nabuse.\\nSales and Operations\\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We also have a global sales force that is\\nfocused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making to\\nreal-time optimizations to post-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and resellers. We operate in\\nmore than 80 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also invest in and rely on self-service tools to provide direct customer\\nsupport to our users and partners.\\nMarketing\\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them, supported by internal efforts to\\nstimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build\\ncommunity around the world.\\nIntellectual Property\\nTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, including know-how, license\\nagreements,  confidentiality  procedures,  non-disclosure  agreements  with  third  parties,  employee  disclosure  and  invention  assignment  agreements,  and  other\\ncontractual rights. In addition, to further protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties. We\\ndo not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of\\nour patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.\\nGovernment Regulation\\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, many of which are still\\nevolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy,\\ndata  use,  data  protection  and  personal  information,  rights  of  publicity,  content,  intellectual  property,  advertising,  marketing,  distribution,  data  security,  data\\nretention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection\\nof minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, anti-corruption\\nand political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding\\nprivacy and protection of people\\'s data. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or\\nbe more restrictive than those in the United States.\\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities,\\nare constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often\\nuncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and\\ninconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users\\nor obtain consent to various practices, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, could adversely affect our financial results. In the\\nUnited States, there have been, and continue to be, various efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230\\nof the Communications Decency Act, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations,\\nwhich could adversely affect our business and financial results.\\n8\\nTable of Contents\\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive\\ncertain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and\\nservices. If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our\\nproducts and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could\\nadversely affect our financial results. For example, the Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the\\nUnited States, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Facebook relies to\\ntransfer  such  data,  such  as  Standard  Contractual  Clauses  (SCCs),  have  been  subjected  to  regulatory  and  judicial  scrutiny.  In  August  2020,  we  received  a\\npreliminary draft decision from the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) that preliminarily concluded that Facebook Ireland\\'s reliance on SCCs in respect of\\nEuropean user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to the United\\nStates should therefore be suspended. Facebook Ireland challenged procedural aspects of this IDPC inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the Irish High Court\\nin September 2020. While we also rely upon alternative legal bases for data transfers, if a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are\\nunable to continue to rely on SCCs or validly rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United States, we may be unable to operate\\nmaterial portions of our business in Europe as a result of the CJEU\\'s invalidation of the Privacy Shield and any final decision of IDPC, which would materially and\\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nProposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation\\n(GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for\\ncompanies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union, and\\nincludes significant penalties for non-compliance. The Brazilian General Data Protection Law recently took effect and imposes data privacy-related requirements\\nsimilar to GDPR on products and services offered to users in Brazil. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, also establishes\\ncertain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users. In addition, effective December 2020, the European Union\\'s ePrivacy Directive includes\\nadditional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business\\npractices as a result of these developments may adversely affect our advertising business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European\\nUnion, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our\\nbusiness,  such  as  liability  for  copyright  infringement.  In  addition,  some  countries  are  considering  or  have  passed  legislation  implementing  data  protection\\nrequirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.\\nWe are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by government\\nauthorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer\\nprotection, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. We are also currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or\\nconsent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and, among\\nother matters, requires us to implement a comprehensive expansion of our privacy program. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by,\\ngovernment  or  regulatory  authorities  could  cause  us  to  incur  substantial  costs,  expose  us  to  unanticipated  civil  and  criminal  liability  or  penalties  (including\\nsubstantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, result in negative publicity\\nand reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that\\nadversely affect our business.\\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-\\nK.\\nHuman Capital\\nAt Facebook, we design products to bring the world closer together, one connection at a time. As a company, we believe that people are at the heart of every\\nconnection we build. We are proud of our unique company culture where ideas, innovation, and impact win, and we work hard to build strong teams across\\nengineering, product design, marketing, and other areas to further our mission.\\n9\\nTable of Contents\\nWe had a global workforce of 58,604 employees as of December 31, 2020, which represents a 30% year-over-year increase in employee headcount. We\\nexpect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future, particularly as we continue to focus on recruiting employees in technical functions. In addition, we\\nplan to continue to hire a number of employees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review initiatives as well as\\nother functions to support our expected growth.\\nOur headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California and we have offices in more than 80 cities around the globe. The vast majority of our personnel are\\ncurrently working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the long term, we expect some personnel to transition to working remotely on a regular\\nbasis.\\nDiversity and Inclusion\\nDiversity  and  inclusion  are  core  to  our  work  at  Facebook.  We  seek  to  build  a  diverse  and  inclusive  workplace  where  we  can  leverage  our  collective\\ncognitive diversity to build the best products and make the best decisions for the global community we serve. While we have made progress, we still have more\\nwork to do.\\nWe publish our global gender diversity and U.S. ethnic diversity workforce data annually. In 2020, we announced that as of June 30, 2020, our global\\nemployee base was comprised of 37% females and 63% males, and our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 44.4% Asian, 41% White,\\n6.3% Hispanic, 4% two or more ethnicities, 3.9% Black, and 0.4% additional groups (including American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian or Other\\nPacific Islander). We also announced our goals to have 50% of our workforce made up of underrepresented populations by 2024, and to increase the representation\\nof people of color in leadership positions in the United States, including Black leadership, by 30% from 2020 to 2025. We will also continue our ongoing efforts to\\nincrease the representation of women in leadership.\\nWe work to support our goals of diversifying our workforce through recruiting, retention, people development, and inclusion. We employ our Diverse\\nSlate  Approach  in  our  global  recruitment  efforts,  which  ensures  that  teams  and  hiring  managers  have  the  opportunity  to  consider  qualified  people  from\\nunderrepresented  groups  for  open  roles.  We  have  seen  steady  increases  in  hiring  rates  of  people  from  underrepresented  groups  since  we  started  testing  this\\napproach in 2015. We also continue  to provide diversity  and inclusion training  for our recruiting  team  and develop inclusive  internship  programs.  Facebook\\nUniversity, our training program for college freshmen and sophomores with an interest in Computer Science, also utilizes a proactive and inclusive approach to\\npromote participation by people from underrepresented groups. To help build community among our people and support their professional development, we invest\\nin our internal Facebook Resource Groups and our annual Community events such as Women\\'s Community Summit, Black Community Summit, Latin Community\\nSummit,  and  Pride  Community  Summit.  We  also  offer  Managing  Unconscious  Bias,  Managing  Inclusion,  and  Be the  Ally trainings  to  promote  an  inclusive\\nworkplace by helping people understand the issues that affect underrepresented communities and how to reduce the effects of bias in the workplace.\\nCompensation and Benefits\\nWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they can focus on our mission. Our employees\\'\\ntotal compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or sales commissions, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the\\ntime of hire and through annual equity grants because we want them to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. We have conducted pay\\nequity analyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. In 2020, we announced that our analyses indicate that we continue to have pay equity\\nacross gender globally and race in the United States for people in similar jobs, accounting for factors such as location, role, and level.\\nThrough Life@ Facebook, our holistic approach to benefits, we provide our employees and their loved ones resources to help them thrive. We offer a wide\\nrange of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community, and time away, including healthcare and wellness benefits, adoption and surrogacy\\nassistance, family care resources, a 401(k) plan, access to tax and legal services, Facebook Resource Groups to build community at Facebook, family leave, and\\npaid time off.\\n10\\nTable of Contents\\nCorporate Information\\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004.

Risk Factors\\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should consider carefully the risks and\\nuncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and\\nrelated notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we\\ncurrently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business,\\nfinancial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our Class A common\\nstock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\\nSummary Risk Factors\\nOur  business  is  subject  to  a  number  of  risks,  including  risks  that  may  prevent  us  from  achieving  our  business  objectives  or  may  adversely  affect  our\\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks\\nrelated to:\\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\\n•\\nour ability to add and retain users and maintain levels of user engagement with our products;\\n•\\nthe loss of, or reduction in spending by, our marketers;\\n•\\nreduced availability of data signals used by our ad targeting and measurement tools;\\n•\\nineffective operation with mobile operating systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners;\\n•\\nfailure of our new products, or changes to our existing products, to attract or retain users or generate revenue;\\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\\n•\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on our advertising business;\\n•\\nour ability to compete effectively;\\n•\\nunfavorable media coverage and other risks affecting our ability to maintain and enhance our brands;\\n•\\nvolatile or slower user and revenue growth rates in the future;\\n•\\nacquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;\\n•\\nour ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in our service;\\n•\\noperating our business in multiple countries around the world;\\n•\\nlitigation, including class action lawsuits;\\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\\n•\\ngovernment restrictions on access to Facebook or our other products, or other actions that impair our ability to sell advertising, in their countries;\\n•\\ncomplex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations;\\n12\\nTable of Contents\\n•\\nthe  impact  of  government  investigations,  enforcement  actions,  and  settlements,  including  litigation  and  investigations  by  privacy  and  competition\\nauthorities;\\n•\\nour ability to comply with regulatory and legislative privacy requirements, including our consent order with the Federal Trade Commission;\\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\\n•\\nthe occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber incidents or undesirable activity on our\\nplatform;\\n•\\nour ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights; and\\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\\n•\\nlimitations on the ability of holders of our Class A Common Stock to influence corporate matters due to the dual class structure of our common stock and\\nthe control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock by our founder, Chairman, and CEO.\\nRisks Related to Our Product Offerings\\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products, our revenue, financial results, and\\nbusiness may be significantly harmed.\\nThe  size  of  our  user  base  and  our  users\\'  level  of  engagement  are  critical  to  our  success.  Our  financial  performance  has  been  and  will  continue  to  be\\nsignificantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products, particularly for Facebook and Instagram. We anticipate that\\nour active user growth rate will generally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases, and we expect that the size of our active user base will\\nfluctuate or decline in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates. For example, beginning in\\nthe first quarter of 2020, we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic. More recently, we have seen user growth and engagement returning to pre-pandemic trends, and in each of the third and fourth quarters of\\n2020, we experienced slight declines on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the number of daily active users on Facebook in the United States & Canada region. We are\\nunable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty, and we expect these trends to continue to be subject to volatility.\\nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the\\nfrequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases\\nor levels of engagement  decline,  in some  cases precipitously.  There is no guarantee  that  we will  not experience  a similar  erosion of our active  user base  or\\nengagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we introduce new and\\ndifferent products and services. Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:\\n•\\nusers increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;\\n•\\nwe fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services, or make changes to\\nexisting products and services, that are not favorably received;\\n•\\nusers feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency, prominence, format, size, and quality\\nof ads that we display;\\n•\\nusers have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we\\nrely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;\\n•\\nuser behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on our products and services;\\n13\\nTable of Contents\\n•\\nwe are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a variety of mobile operating systems and\\nnetworks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\\n•\\nthere are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our user data practices, concerns about the\\nnature of content made available on our products, or concerns related to privacy, safety, security, well-being, or other factors;\\n•\\nwe are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is appropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant to\\nthem;\\n•\\nwe are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;\\n•\\nwe are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our\\nother products;\\n•\\nusers adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may not be featured or otherwise\\navailable;\\n•\\nthere are changes mandated by legislation, government and regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely affect our products or users;\\n•\\nwe are unable to operate material portions of our business in Europe, or are otherwise limited in such operations, as a result of European regulators,\\ncourts, or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user\\ndata from the European Union to the United States is invalid;\\n•\\nthere  is  decreased  engagement  with  our  products,  or  failure  to  accept  our  terms  of  service,  as  part  of  privacy-focused  changes  that  we  have\\nimplemented or may implement in the future, whether voluntarily, in connection with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European\\nUnion\\'s ePrivacy Directive, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), or other laws, regulations, or regulatory actions, or otherwise;\\n•\\ntechnical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience, such as\\nsecurity breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content;\\n•\\nwe adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising, or take actions to enforce our policies, that\\nare perceived negatively by our users or the general public, including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight\\nBoard regarding content on our platform;\\n•\\nwe elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth and engagement;\\n•\\nwe make changes in how we promote different products and services across our family of products;\\n•\\ninitiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a result of actions by us, third parties, or\\notherwise;\\n•\\nthird-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans, are discontinued;\\n•\\nthere is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other mobile applications in certain\\ncountries, internet shutdowns, or other actions by governments that affect the accessibility of our products in their countries;\\n•\\nwe fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;\\n14\\nTable of Contents\\n•\\nwe, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry are the subject of adverse media\\nreports or other negative publicity, including as a result of our or their user data practices; or\\n•\\nour current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers to build, grow, and\\nmonetize mobile and web applications, reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for our users to interact and share on third-party\\nmobile and web applications.\\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to varying degrees. If we are unable to maintain\\nor increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our significant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financial\\nresults may be adversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products less attractive to users, marketers,\\nand developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of operations. If our active user\\ngrowth rate continues to slow, we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to\\ndrive revenue growth.\\nWe  generate  substantially  all  of  our  revenue  from  advertising.  The  loss  of  marketers,  or  reduction  in  spending  by  marketers,  could  seriously  harm  our\\nbusiness.\\nSubstantially  all  of  our  revenue  is  currently  generated  from  third  parties  advertising  on  Facebook  and  Instagram.  As  is  common  in  the  industry,  our\\nmarketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget\\nwith us. Marketers will not continue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in an effective\\nmanner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives. We have implemented,\\nand we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent\\nadversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the\\npricing of our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed.\\nOur advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\\n•\\ndecreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;\\n•\\nour inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;\\n•\\nproduct changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence of ads displayed\\non our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products;\\n•\\nour inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;\\n•\\nour inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;\\n•\\nchanges  to  third-party  policies  that  limit  our  ability  to  deliver,  target,  or  measure  the  effectiveness  of  advertising,  including  changes  by  mobile\\noperating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;\\n•\\nadverse government actions or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to advertising, including developments that may impact\\nour ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;\\n•\\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize, including as a result of increased\\nusage of the Stories format or our messaging products;\\n•\\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the security and integrity of our\\nplatform;\\n15\\nTable of Contents\\n•\\nthe availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our\\nads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\\n•\\nloss  of  advertising  market  share  to  our  competitors,  including  if  prices  to  purchase  our  ads  increase  or  if  competitors  offer  lower  priced,  more\\nintegrated, or otherwise more effective products;\\n•\\nlimitations  on our ability to operate material portions of our business in Europe as a result of European regulators,  courts, or legislative  bodies\\ndetermining that our reliance on SCCs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States is invalid;\\n•\\nchanges in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of risks related to complying with foreign\\nlaws or regulatory requirements or other government actions;\\n•\\ndecisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us, our user data practices,\\nour advertising metrics or tools, content on our products, our efforts to implement or enforce policies relating to content on our products (including as\\na result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board), developers with mobile and web applications that are integrated\\nwith our products, or other companies in our industry;\\n•\\nreductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content made available on our products by third parties, questions about our user data\\npractices, concerns about brand safety or potential legal liability, or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligations (for example, a\\nnumber of marketers announced that they paused advertising with us in July 2020 due to concerns about content on our products);\\n•\\nthe effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt out of the use of data for ads, including as a result of product changes and controls\\nthat we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, California Consumer Privacy Act\\n(CCPA), other laws, regulations, or regulatory actions, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data for advertising purposes;\\n•\\nthe degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;\\n•\\nchanges in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;\\n•\\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;\\n•\\nchanges in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and\\n•\\nthe impact of macroeconomic conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among specific types of marketers or within particular\\ngeographies.\\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The occurrence of any of these or other\\nfactors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stop advertising\\nwith us altogether, either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results. For example, macroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in\\nthe future affect, marketers\\' ability or willingness to spend with us, as we have seen with the regional and worldwide economic disruption related to the COVID-19\\npandemic and associated declines in advertising activity on our products. The effects of the pandemic previously resulted in reduced demand for our ads, a related\\ndecline in pricing of our ads, and additional demands on our technical infrastructure as a result of increased usage of our services, and any similar occurrences in\\nthe future may impair our ability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users and adversely affect our revenue and financial results.\\n16\\nTable of Contents\\nOur advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do\\nnot control, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-party mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and we\\nexpect will continue to impact, the availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.\\nWe rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Our\\nadvertising  revenue  is  dependent  on  targeting  and  measurement  tools  that  incorporate  these  signals,  and  any  changes  in  our  ability  to  use  such  signals  will\\nadversely affect our business. For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and CCPA, have impacted, and we\\nexpect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen an increasing number of users opt out of certain types\\nof ad targeting in Europe following adoption of the GDPR, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California\\nfollowing adoption of the CCPA. Regulatory guidance or decisions or new legislation may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that\\nfurther reduce our ability to use these signals. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced product\\nchanges as well as future plans to limit the ability of application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in June\\n2020, Apple announced that it plans to make certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with the release of its iOS 14 operating system that\\nwill reduce our and other iOS developers\\' ability to target and measure advertising, which we expect will in turn reduce the budgets marketers are willing to\\ncommit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the ability to\\nlimit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including our Off-Facebook Activity tool and our worldwide\\noffering  of  certain  product  changes  we  implemented  in  connection  with  the  GDPR.  These  developments  have  limited  our  ability  to  target  and  measure  the\\neffectiveness of ads on our platform, and negatively impacted our advertising revenue, and if we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further\\neffect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our future\\nadvertising revenue growth.\\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies,\\nproducts, and standards that we do not control.\\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to\\nfeature Facebook or our other products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on the\\ninteroperability of Facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control,\\nsuch as the Android and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Any changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with\\nmobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products\\'\\nfunctionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our ability to deliver,\\ntarget, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or charge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of\\nFacebook or our other products and monetization on mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the use of\\nthird-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and more recently announced changes to\\niOS 14 that will limit our ability to target and measure ads effectively. We expect that any similar changes to its, Google\\'s, or other browser or mobile platforms\\nwill further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products,\\nit is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and standards that we do not control, and that we have\\ngood relationships with handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, and browser developers. We may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with\\nkey participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. In\\nthe event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use Facebook or our other products on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use\\nFacebook or our other products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to Facebook or our other products, our user growth and user\\nengagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on\\nwhat we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating\\nsystems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other business partners, or advertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will result\\nin the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our\\nuser growth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected\\n17\\nTable of Contents\\nand our business could be harmed. We have in the past experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and\\nstandards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices,\\nwhich may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nOur new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits.\\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing\\nproducts and to create successful new products, both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changes\\nto our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or\\noperating experience. For example, we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology, which may\\nadversely  affect  our  ability  to  successfully  develop  and  market  these  products  and  technologies.  We  continue  to  incur  substantial  costs,  and  we  may  not  be\\nsuccessful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts. In addition, the introduction of new products, or changes to existing products, may result in new\\nor enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, or other complications that could adversely affect our business and financial results. We have also\\ninvested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our WhatsApp and Messenger products to support increasing usage of such products.\\nWe have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from\\nmessaging over the long term. In addition, we are moving forward with plans to implement end-to-end encryption across our messaging services, as well as\\nfacilitate cross-app communication between these platforms, which plans have drawn governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. If our new or\\nenhanced products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate\\nsufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.\\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with\\nour mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented,\\nand we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent\\nadversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, our Off-Facebook Activity tool enables users to place limits on our\\nstorage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers\\' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective ads\\nto our users. Similarly, from time to time we update our News Feed ranking algorithm to optimize the user experience, and these changes have had, and may in the\\nfuture have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with Facebook, which could adversely affect our financial results. From time\\nto time, we may also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience. In addition, we have\\nmade, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and\\ndevelopers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on Facebook or our other products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to\\nexisting products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of\\nmonetization. For example, we previously introduced the Stories format, which we do not currently monetize at the same rate as News Feed. In addition, as we\\nfocus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement\\nwith one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. These decisions\\nmay adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business\\nand financial results may be harmed.\\nWe believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is\\ncritical to expanding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will\\ndepend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce\\nnew\\n18\\nTable of Contents\\nproducts or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers\\nmay affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party mobile and web applications integrated with our products or interacting with\\nparties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user\\nprivacy, data use, encryption, content, advertising, competition, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or the COVID‑19\\npandemic, which has in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our reputation and brands. For example, in March 2018, we announced\\ndevelopments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to\\nrespond  expeditiously  or  appropriately  to  the  sharing  of  objectionable  content  on  our  services  or  objectionable  practices  by  advertisers  or  developers,  or  to\\notherwise address user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in our brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected by\\nthe actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our\\nproducts  or  services  to  disseminate  information  that  is  deemed  to  be  misleading  (or  intended  to  manipulate  opinions),  by  perceived  or  actual  efforts  by\\ngovernments to obtain access to user information for security-related purposes or to censor certain content on our platform, by the use of our products or services\\nfor illicit or objectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around the pandemic or elections in the United States and around the world, by decisions\\nor recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent Oversight Board, or by our decisions to remove content or suspend participation on\\nour platform by persons who violate our community standards or terms of service. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial\\ninvestments and these investments may not be successful. Certain of our past actions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns\\naround our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, have eroded confidence in our brands, and if we fail to successfully\\npromote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.\\nWe may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and\\nour other products.\\nWe have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with\\nFacebook  and  our  other  products.  Such  existing  and  prospective  developers  may  not  be  successful  in  building,  growing,  or  monetizing  mobile  and/or  web\\napplications that create and maintain user engagement. Additionally, developers may choose to build on other platforms, including mobile platforms controlled by\\nthird parties, rather than building products that integrate with Facebook and our other products. We are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives\\nof our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience, and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain\\nsuch developers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on Facebook and\\nour  other  products  with  the  objective  of  enhancing  the  user  experience,  and  such  actions  have  reduced  distribution  from,  user  engagement  with,  and  our\\nmonetization  opportunities  from,  mobile  and  web  applications  integrated  with  our  products.  In  addition,  as  part  of  our  efforts  related  to  privacy,  safety,  and\\nsecurity,  we  conduct  investigations  and  audits  of  platform  applications  from  time  to  time,  and  we  also  have  announced  several  product  changes  that  restrict\\ndeveloper access to certain user data. In some instances, these actions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adversely\\naffected, or will adversely affect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to maintain or grow the number of developers that\\nchoose to build products that integrate with Facebook and our other products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such\\ndevelopers, our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.\\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may in the future have, a significant adverse impact on our advertising revenue and also exposes our business to other\\nrisks.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, such\\nas travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders. These measures have caused, and are continuing to cause,\\nbusiness slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide, which have significantly impacted our business and results of operations. For\\nexample, in the second quarter of 2020, our advertising revenue grew 10% year-over-year, which was the slowest growth rate for any fiscal quarter since our initial\\npublic offering. While our advertising revenue growth rate improved in subsequent\\n19\\nTable of Contents\\nquarters,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  it  will  not  decrease  again  as  a  result  of  the  effects  of  the  pandemic.  In  addition,  we  believe  that  the  pandemic  has\\ncontributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce from offline to online, as well as increasing consumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to\\nservices, which in turn have increased demand for our advertising services; however, it is possible that this increased demand may not continue in future periods\\nand may even recede as the effects of the pandemic subside, which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth. The demand for and pricing of our\\nadvertising services may be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the foreseeable future, and we are unable to predict the duration or degree of\\nsuch impact with any certainty. In addition to the impact on our advertising business, the pandemic exposes our business, operations, and workforce to a variety of\\nother risks, including:\\n•\\nvolatility in the size of our user base and user engagement, particularly for our messaging products, whether as a result of shelter-in-place measures\\nor other factors;\\n•\\ndecreased user engagement as a result of users\\' inability to purchase data packs or devices to access our products and services;\\n•\\ninterruptions in the accessibility or performance of our products and services due to capacity constraints from increased usage, or product changes we\\nimplement to maintain accessibility of our services, such as reducing the quality of video to reduce bandwidth usage;\\n•\\ndelays  in  product  development  or releases,  or  reductions  in  manufacturing  production  and  sales  of  consumer  hardware,  as  a  result  of inventory\\nshortages, supply chain or labor shortages, or diversion of our efforts and resources to projects related to COVID-19;\\n•\\nincreased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties, including improper advertising practices or other activity inconsistent with\\nour terms, contracts, or policies, misinformation or other illicit or objectionable material on our platforms, election interference, or other undesirable\\nactivity; \\n•\\nadverse impacts to our efforts to combat misuse of our products and services and user data as a result of limitations on our safety, security, and\\ncontent review efforts while our workforce is working remotely, such as the necessity to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence to perform tasks\\nthat our workforce is unable to perform; \\n•\\nour inability to recognize revenue, collect payment, or generate future revenue from marketers, including from those that have been or may be forced\\nto close their businesses or are otherwise impacted by the economic downturn;\\n•\\nincreased expenses resulting from our initiatives or donations related to the pandemic;\\n•\\nsignificant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in currency exchange rates or negatively impact our\\nability to access capital in the future;\\n•\\nnegative impact on our workforce productivity, product development, and research and development due to difficulties resulting from our personnel\\nworking remotely; \\n•\\nillnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce, which may result in inefficiencies, delays, and disruptions in our business; and\\n•\\nincreased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our financial statements.\\nAny of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory actions against us. The persistence of\\nCOVID-19, and the preventative measures implemented to help limit the spread of the illness, have impacted, and will continue to impact, our ability to operate\\nour business and may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\\nWe compete with companies providing connection and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell advertising to\\nbusinesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing\\n20\\nTable of Contents\\nand optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the\\nability of users to share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences, including,\\nfor example, Google, Apple, YouTube, Tencent, Snap, Twitter, ByteDance, Microsoft, and Amazon. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our\\nproducts, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling\\nmobile and web applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual reality\\nproducts and services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, we\\nmay become subject to additional competition.\\nSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments, geographic regions,\\nor user demographics than we do. For example, some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory\\nregimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging\\ntechnologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users, particularly younger users, are aware of and actively engaging with other products and\\nservices similar to, or as a substitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement with our products\\nand services in favor of these other products and services. In the event that users increasingly engage with other products and services, we may experience a\\ndecline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly, in which case our business would likely be harmed.\\nOur competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and\\nsuccessful  product  development  efforts  or  marketing  campaigns,  or  may  adopt  more  aggressive  pricing  policies.  Some  competitors  may  gain  a  competitive\\nadvantage against us in areas where we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads; by\\nimposing fees or other charges related  to our delivery  of ads; by making access to our products more difficult  or impossible;  by making it more difficult  to\\ncommunicate with our users; or by integrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems,\\nsearch  engines,  browsers,  or  e-commerce  platforms.  For  example,  each  of  Apple  and  Google  have  integrated  competitive  products  with  iOS  and  Android,\\nrespectively. In addition, Apple has announced changes to iOS 14 that will limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target and\\nmeasure ads effectively. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense\\nof our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business and financial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive\\nthreats, but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results.\\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\\n•\\nthe popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our competitors\\' products;\\n•\\nthe size and composition of our user base;\\n•\\nthe engagement of users with our products and competing products;\\n•\\nour ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;\\n•\\nthe timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors\\' products;\\n•\\nour safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their data;\\n•\\nour ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;\\n•\\nour ability to monetize our products;\\n21\\nTable of Contents\\n•\\nthe frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;\\n•\\ncustomer service and support efforts;\\n•\\nmarketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on their\\ninvestments;\\n•\\nour ability to establish and maintain developers\\' interest in building mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products;\\n•\\nour ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with Facebook and our other products;\\n•\\nchanges mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;\\n•\\nacquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;\\n•\\nour ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and product managers;\\n•\\nour ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and\\n•\\nour reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.\\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our user base and level of user engagement may decrease, we may become less attractive to developers and\\nmarketers, and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\\nUnfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business from time to time.\\nWe  receive  a  high  degree  of  media  coverage  around  the  world.  Unfavorable  publicity  regarding,  for  example,  our privacy  practices,  terms  of service,\\nadvertising policies, product changes, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity, government surveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our\\ndevelopers whose products are integrated with our products, the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, the substance or enforcement of our\\ncommunity standards, the actions of our users, the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform, or the actions of other companies that provide similar\\nservices to ours, has in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect our reputation. For example, we have been the subject of significant media coverage\\ninvolving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, and we continue to receive negative publicity related to\\nthese topics. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit or\\nobjectionable use of our products or services, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and elections in the United States and around the world. Any\\nsuch negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our products,\\nwhich could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have experienced such adverse effects to varying degrees\\nfrom time to time.\\nOur financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\\nOur quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have a limited operating history with the current\\nscale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future results. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of\\nfuture performance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets. Our financial\\nresults in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:\\n•\\nour ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement;\\n22\\nTable of Contents\\n•\\nour ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;\\n•\\nour ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers in a particular period, including as a result of the effects of the COVID-19\\npandemic;\\n•\\nfluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year, episodic regional\\nor global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors;\\n•\\nthe frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;\\n•\\nthe success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;\\n•\\nchanges  to  third-party  policies  that  limit  our  ability  to  deliver,  target,  or  measure  the  effectiveness  of  advertising,  including  changes  by  mobile\\noperating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;\\n•\\nthe pricing of our ads and other products;\\n•\\nthe diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;\\n•\\nour ability to generate revenue from Payments, or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we may introduce in the future;\\n•\\nchanges to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors;\\n•\\nuser behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize;\\n•\\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive, including\\ncosts related to our data centers and technical infrastructure;\\n•\\ncosts related to our privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts, including as a result of implementing changes to our practices, whether\\nvoluntarily, in connection with laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board, or\\notherwise;\\n•\\ncosts and expenses related to the development and delivery of our consumer hardware products;\\n•\\nour ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;\\n•\\ncosts related to acquisitions, including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop the acquired technologies;\\n•\\ncharges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet;\\n•\\nour ability to obtain equipment, components, and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in a timely and cost-effective manner;\\n•\\nsystem failures or outages or government blocking, which could prevent us from serving ads for any period of time;\\n•\\nbreaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation;\\n•\\nchanges in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to third-party actions;\\n•\\nfees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products;\\n23\\nTable of Contents\\n•\\nrefunds or other concessions provided to advertisers;\\n•\\nshare-based compensation expense, including acquisition-related expense;\\n•\\nadverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;\\n•\\nchanges in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy and data protection, or actions by governments or regulators,\\nincluding fines, orders, or consent decrees;\\n•\\nthe overall tax rate for our business, which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the U.S. and in jurisdictions with different tax rates, the effects\\nof share-based compensation, the effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, the effects of changes in our business or structure, and\\nthe effects of discrete items such as legal and tax settlements and tax elections;\\n•\\nthe impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in the period such laws are enacted or\\ninterpretations are issued, and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period;\\n•\\ntax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations, including the examination we are currently under by the Internal Revenue Service\\n(IRS), that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated;\\n•\\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;\\n•\\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program;\\n•\\nfluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities, in the valuation of our equity investments, and in interest rates;\\n•\\nchanges in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and\\n•\\nchanges in regional or global business or macroeconomic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may impact the other\\nfactors described above.\\nWe expect our rates of growth to be volatile in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and to decline over time in the future.\\nWe expect our user and revenue growth rates to be volatile in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, although we are unable to predict the\\nduration or degree of such volatility with any certainty. In the long term, we expect that our user growth rate will generally decline over time as the size of our\\nactive  user  base  increases,  and  the  size  of  our  active  user  base  may  fluctuate  or  decline  in  one  or  more  markets,  particularly  as  we  achieve  greater  market\\npenetration. We also expect our revenue growth rate will continue to decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels. As our growth rates experience\\nvolatility or decline, investors\\' perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\\nOur costs are continuing to grow, and some of our investments, particularly our investments in virtual and augmented reality, have the effect of reducing our\\noperating margin and profitability. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\\nOperating our business is costly, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base, as users increase the amount\\nand types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for example with respect to video, as we develop and implement new products, as we market\\nnew  and  existing  products  and  promote  our  brands,  as  we  continue  to  expand  our  technical  infrastructure,  as  we  continue  to  invest  in  new  and  unproven\\ntechnologies, and as we continue to hire additional employees and contractors to support our expanding operations, including our efforts to focus on privacy,\\nsafety, security, and content review. In addition, from time to time we are subject to settlements, judgments,\\n24\\nTable of Contents\\nfines, or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and regulatory developments that may be material to our business. We are also continuing to increase\\nour investments in new platforms and technologies. Some of these investments, particularly our significant investments in virtual and augmented reality, have\\ngenerated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability, and we expect the adverse financial impact of such investments to continue for\\nthe foreseeable future. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.\\nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and may\\nadversely affect the price of our common stock.\\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies,\\nproducts, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other strategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be able to find\\nsuitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, if at all, including as a result of\\nregulatory challenges. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions or other strategic transactions may be substantial, and there is no assurance that we will receive\\na favorable return on investment for our acquisitions or other strategic transactions.\\nWe may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which has occurred in the past and could\\nadversely  affect  our liquidity.  The incurrence  of indebtedness  would also result in increased  fixed obligations  and increased  interest  expense, and could also\\ninclude covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we\\nregularly  grant  RSUs to  retain  the  employees  of acquired  companies,  which  could  increase  our  expenses,  adversely  affect  our  financial  results,  and  result  in\\ndilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users, marketers, developers,\\nor investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock.\\nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance, which\\nmay  result  in  significant  unanticipated  costs.  The  effectiveness  of  our  due  diligence  review  and  our  ability  to  evaluate  the  results  of  such  due  diligence  are\\ndependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives, as well\\nas the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other\\nstrategic transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant additional\\nexpenses  to  our  results  of  operations  and  recording  of  substantial  finite-lived  intangible  assets  on  our  balance  sheet  upon  closing.  Any  of  these  factors  may\\nadversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire.\\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, and we may not manage these processes successfully. Our ability to successfully\\nintegrate complex acquisitions is unproven, particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have\\nprior experience. We continue to make substantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions, which will result in significant ongoing operating expenses\\nand may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail to\\nsuccessfully integrate the companies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption in our service, including as a result\\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results.\\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical\\ninfrastructure. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to\\ntime. Our systems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays or outages that\\ncould be harmful to our business. If our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may not\\nuse our products as often in the future, or at all, and our ability to serve ads may be\\n25\\nTable of Contents\\ndisrupted, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. As the amount and types of information shared on Facebook and our other\\nproducts continue to grow and evolve, as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve, and as our internal operational demands continue to grow,\\nwe will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our needs. It is possible that\\nwe may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our user\\nengagement and advertising revenue growth. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from earthquakes, adverse\\nweather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events. If\\nsuch an event were to occur, users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a\\ntimely manner to restart or provide our services, which may adversely affect our financial results.\\nFor example, the increase in the use of our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic increased demands on our technical infrastructure. Additional\\nproduct development efforts during this time have put additional pressure on our technical infrastructure. We may not be able to accommodate these demands,\\nincluding as a result of our reduced data center operations and personnel working remotely during the pandemic.\\nA substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers\\ncould harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may\\nadversely affect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. The\\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the risk of supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logistics or the supply chain for our technical\\ninfrastructure. As a result, we may not be able to procure sufficient equipment or services from third parties to satisfy our needs, or we may be required to procure\\nsuch services or equipment on unfavorable terms.\\nAny of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products, require unfavorable changes to existing products,\\ndelay the introduction of future products, or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nWe could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.\\nWe have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products, and we plan to\\ncontinue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects.\\nThe infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in emerging markets that\\nexpose us to increased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance and political challenges, among others. We have in the past suspended, and may in the future\\nsuspend,  certain  of  these  projects  as a  result  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic.  Additional  unanticipated  delays  or  disruptions  in  the  completion  of these  projects,\\nincluding due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects, or availability of components, challenges in obtaining required government\\nor regulatory approvals, or other geopolitical challenges or actions by governments, whether as a result of the pandemic, trade disputes, or otherwise, may lead to\\nincreased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality or reliability of our products, or impairment of assets\\non our balance sheet. In addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation,\\nwhich may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment, that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs.\\nFurther, much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the United States, and it is possible that action by a foreign government, or our response to such\\ngovernment action, could result in the impairment of a portion of our technical infrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the quality or reliability\\nof our products and lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\\nThe numbers for our key metrics, which include our Facebook metrics (DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU)) and Family metrics (DAP,\\nMAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP)), are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based\\non what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our\\nproducts across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require\\n26\\nTable of Contents\\nsignificant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user\\nbase, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and\\nfrom time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics.\\nOur ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such\\nadjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins\\ndisclosed below.\\nIn addition, our Facebook metrics and Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology.\\nWe regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \"duplicate\" and \"false\" accounts among our MAUs. A duplicate account is one that a\\nuser maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide \"false\" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created\\npersonal profiles for a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a Page rather than a personal profile\\nunder our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of\\nservice, such as bots and spam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply\\nsignificant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar user\\nnames, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. Any loss of access to\\ndata signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative\\nrequirements, limitations while our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our\\nestimates of duplicate and false accounts. Our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or\\ntechnologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader\\npopulation of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false\\naccounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our worldwide MAUs. We believe the\\npercentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. In\\nthe fourth quarter of 2020, we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately 5% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts can\\nvary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as Indonesia and\\nVietnam. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts\\namong our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate and\\nfalse accounts among our MAUs on an annual basis.\\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual\\nproduct. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not\\nreflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook,\\nInstagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\\ntherefore  must  seek  to  attribute  multiple  user  accounts  within  and  across  products  to  individual  people.  To  calculate  these  metrics,  we  rely  upon  complex\\ntechniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accounts\\nwithin an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one\\nperson. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject to statistical\\nvariances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While\\nwe  expect  the  error  margin  for  our  Family  metrics  to  vary  from  period  to  period,  we  estimate  that  such  margin  generally  will  be  approximately  4%  of  our\\nworldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the\\nactual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is\\nalso possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\\n27\\nTable of Contents\\nTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of\\nlimited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates.\\nFor example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses,\\nand user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which are inherently\\nsubject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family\\nmetrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our\\nFamily metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some\\nproducts compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and\\nprimarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although Messenger\\nKids users are included in our Family metrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating DAP and\\nMAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-\\nparty browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, limitations while our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other\\nfactors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve,\\nincluding through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning\\nthat may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution\\nmay allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \"violating\" accounts. We define \"violating\" accounts\\nas accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we\\nestimated that approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample\\nof  accounts,  and  we  apply  significant  judgment  in  making  this  determination.  For  example,  we  look  for  account  information  and  behaviors  associated  with\\nFacebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In\\naddition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we\\nbelieve they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other\\nactions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to\\ndisclose our estimates of the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at\\nour scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates a decline in\\nusage among younger users, this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, our\\nunderstanding of usage by age group may not be complete.\\nIn addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user\\'s IP address and self-\\ndisclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user\\'s actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the\\nlocation of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user\\'s actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible\\nto algorithm or other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.\\nIn addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads.\\nMany of our metrics involve the use of estimations and judgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, and\\nhuman error. Where marketers, developers, or investors do not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where we discover material inaccuracies in our\\nmetrics or estimates, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may be harmed, and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or\\nresources to Facebook or our other products, which could negatively affect our business and financial results.\\n28\\nTable of Contents\\nWe cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth.\\nOur employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly, with the number of employees increasing to 58,604 as\\nof December 31, 2020 from 44,942 as of December 31, 2019, and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan to\\ncontinue to hire a number of employees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review initiatives as well as other\\nfunctions to support our expected growth. The growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management, operational,\\nand financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users, marketers, developers, and other third parties. As our operations and the number of\\nour third-party relationships continue to grow, our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support such\\ngrowth. In addition, some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation, so our management may\\nnot be able to manage such growth effectively. Additionally, the vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely as a result of the COVID-19\\npandemic, which limits their ability to perform certain job functions and may negatively impact productivity. In the long term, we may experience such challenges\\nto productivity and collaboration as some personnel transition to working remotely on a regular basis, and we may experience difficulties integrating recently hired\\npersonnel  when  our  offices  re-open.  To  effectively  manage  our  growth,  we  must  continue  to  adapt  to  a  remote  work  environment;  improve  our  operational,\\nfinancial, and management processes and systems; and effectively expand, train, and manage our personnel. As our organization continues to grow, and we are\\nrequired to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture,\\nincluding our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance.\\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have more limited operating experience, and\\nthis may subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks that could affect our financial results.\\nWe have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products.\\nWe currently make Facebook available in more than 100 different languages, and we have offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries. We may enter\\nnew international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are generally available globally,\\nbut some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, Facebook and\\ncertain of our other products are not generally available in China. We also outsource certain operational functions to third-party vendors globally. If we fail to\\ndeploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing\\nbusiness internationally, including:\\n•\\npolitical, social, or economic instability;\\n•\\nrisks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions,\\nincluding  with  respect  to  privacy,  tax,  law  enforcement,  content,  trade  compliance,  competition,  consumer  protection,  intellectual  property,  and\\ninfrastructure matters;\\n•\\npotential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or requirements to provide user\\ninformation to local authorities;\\n•\\nenhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different languages and countries;\\n•\\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;\\n•\\nforeign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the United\\nStates or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently;\\n•\\nhigher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\\n29\\nTable of Contents\\n•\\nenhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\\n•\\nburdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal, data localization, payments, and regulatory\\noversight;\\n•\\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\\n•\\ndifficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated\\nwith multiple international locations, including difficulties arising from personnel working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic;\\n•\\ncompliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\\n•\\ngeopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes and pandemics.\\nIn addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given jurisdiction and our obligations to comply with\\nlaws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations applicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010.\\nWe also must manage our obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to export controls, sanctions, and embargoes, including regulations established\\nby the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose\\nagainst companies for violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations, export controls, and other laws, rules, sanctions, embargoes, and regulations.\\nIf  we  are  unable  to  expand  internationally  and  manage  the  complexity  of  our  global  operations  successfully,  our  financial  results  could  be  adversely\\naffected.\\nWe face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our financial results.\\nWe face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our consumer hardware products. For example,\\nthe consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the\\nproducts, or from the software used in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers.\\nOur brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures to meet our customers\\' expectations, or findings of our\\nconsumer hardware products to be defective.\\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products, which subjects us to a\\nnumber of risks that have been exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We may experience supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logistics\\nor the supply chain that could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product development, and sales. We could be negatively affected if\\nwe are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations\\n(whether  due  to  financial  difficulties,  manufacturing  constraints,  or  other  reasons),  or  make  adverse  changes  in  the  pricing  or  other  material  terms  of  such\\narrangements  with  them.  The  manufacturing,  distribution,  and  sale  of  our  consumer  hardware  products  also  may  be  negatively  impacted  by  macroeconomic\\nconditions, geopolitical challenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments that subject us to supply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain disruptions.\\nWe  also  require  the  suppliers  and  business  partners  of  our  consumer  hardware  products  to  comply  with  laws  and  certain  company  policies  regarding\\nsourcing practices and standards on labor, health and safety, the environment, and business ethics, but we do not control them or their practices and standards. If\\nany of them violates laws, fails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical, corrupt,\\nor non-compliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines, canceled orders, or damage to our reputation.\\nWe face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.\\nWe are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in\\n30\\nTable of Contents\\nproduct cycles and pricing, unsafe or defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with\\nrespect  to  our  consumer  hardware  products,  and  other  factors.  The  demand  for  our  products  can  also  change  significantly  between  the  time  inventory  or\\ncomponents are ordered and the date of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer hardware\\nproducts we may sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products. In addition,\\nwhen we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international markets, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships,\\ndetermine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require\\nsignificant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our operating results.\\nWe are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could harm\\nour business, financial condition, or results of operations.\\nWe  are  involved  in  numerous  lawsuits,  including  stockholder  derivative  lawsuits  and  putative  class  action  lawsuits,  many  of  which  claim  statutory\\ndamages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future.\\nBecause of the scale of our user, advertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages\\neven if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to additional class action\\nlawsuits based on claims related to advertising, antitrust, privacy, content, employment, or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer\\nhardware and software, as well as virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. For example, we are currently the subject of multiple\\nputative class action suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third\\nparties  in  violation  of  our  terms  and  policies;  the  disclosure  of  our  earnings  results  for  the  second  quarter  of  2018;  and  our  acquisitions  of  Instagram  and\\nWhatsApp, as well as other alleged anticompetitive conduct. We also agreed to settle certain lawsuits in connection with the \"tag suggestions\" facial recognition\\nfeature  on  Facebook  and  a  third-party  cyber-attack  that  exploited  a  vulnerability  in  Facebook\\'s  code  to  steal  user  access  tokens  and  access  certain  profile\\ninformation from user accounts on Facebook. The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any negative outcome from any\\nsuch lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable changes to our products or business practices, and accordingly our\\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\\nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant\\nburden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon\\nappeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which has occurred in the past\\nand which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.\\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\\nOur  tax  obligations,  including  income  and  non-income  taxes,  are  based  in  part  on  our  corporate  operating  structure  and  intercompany  arrangements,\\nincluding the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of our intercompany\\ntransactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain\\njurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Facebook. We are subject to\\nregular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities.  Tax authorities  may disagree with certain  positions we have taken, including our\\nmethodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide\\neffective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For\\nexample, in 2016 and 2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the\\n2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS\\'s position and are litigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a\\nmanner unfavorable to us, may adversely affect our financial results.\\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many\\ntransactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and\\nany changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and\\nestimates of\\n31\\nTable of Contents\\nour non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect\\nour financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\\nOur future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit split, changes in the amount and recognition of\\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.\\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\\nThe  tax  regimes  we  are  subject  to  or  operate  under,  including  income  and  non-income  taxes,  are  unsettled  and  may  be  subject  to  significant  change.\\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash\\nflows. For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for\\nthe fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions in the\\nUnited States, could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such actions take effect. In addition, many\\ncountries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have\\nenacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we\\noperate our business.\\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, and issued a report in 2015,\\nan interim report in 2018, and blueprints in 2020 that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are\\ndetermined in many of the countries in which we do business. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to\\nvarious aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well\\nas proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several countries have proposed\\nor enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which includes business activities on social media platforms and online marketplaces, and which apply to our\\nbusiness.\\nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides\\npreferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in\\ncertain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.\\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described above\\ncould increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of\\noperations, and cash flows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and\\nrecorded in our financial statements.\\nGiven our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price.\\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period. In periods in which our\\nstock price is higher than the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease our\\neffective tax rate. For example, in 2020, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $656 million\\nand our effective tax rate by two percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. In future periods in which our stock price is lower than the\\ngrant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may increase. The amount and value of share-based compensation issued\\nrelative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects\\nare dependent on our stock price, which we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect\\nour financial results.\\n32\\nTable of Contents\\nIf our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\\nWe review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable,\\nsuch as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. If such goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets are\\ndeemed to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized. We may be\\nrequired to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets is\\ndetermined, which would negatively affect our results of operations.\\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.\\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl K. Sandberg. Although we\\nhave entered into employment agreements with Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, the agreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. In\\naddition,  many  of  our  key  technologies  and  systems  are  custom-made  for  our  business  by  our  personnel.  The  loss  of  key  personnel,  including  members  of\\nmanagement as well as key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our\\nbusiness.\\nAs  we  continue  to  grow,  we  cannot  guarantee  we  will  continue  to  attract  and  retain  the  personnel  we  need  to  maintain  our  competitive  position.  In\\nparticular,  we  intend  to  continue  to  hire  a  significant  number  of  technical  personnel  in  the  foreseeable  future,  and  we  expect  to  continue  to  face  significant\\nchallenges in hiring such personnel, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located, whether as a result of competition with other\\ncompanies, challenges due to the high cost of living, facilities and infrastructure constraints, or other factors. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract,\\nretain, and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue significant equity to\\nattract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial additional share-based compensation expense and the ownership of our\\nexisting stockholders would be further diluted. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility. As a\\nresult of these factors, it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our employees. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating\\nexcellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively.\\nOur CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\\nMark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding\\ncapital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any\\nmerger,  consolidation,  or  sale  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  our  assets.  This  concentrated  control  could  delay,  defer,  or  prevent  a  change  of  control,  merger,\\nconsolidation,  or  sale  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  our  assets  that  our  other  stockholders  support,  or  conversely  this  concentrated  control  could  result  in  the\\nconsummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring\\nour Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock.\\nIn addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our CEO and\\nhis ability to control the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death, the shares of our capital stock that Mr. Zuckerberg\\nowns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated. As a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders\\nand must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder,\\nMr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement, in his own interests, which may not\\nalways be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases\\ncould also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves.\\n33\\nTable of Contents\\nAlthough our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date, the program does not obligate us to\\nrepurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our Class A common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will be\\nfully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any\\nannouncement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves.\\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement\\nActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, or that otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their\\ncountries, could substantially harm our business and financial results.\\nGovernments from time to time seek to censor content available on Facebook or our other products in their country, restrict access to our products from their\\ncountry entirely, or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely. For\\nexample, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in China, Iran, and North Korea. In\\naddition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or a threat to\\npublic safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from time to time. For example, in June 2020,\\nHong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and block access to content, and suspend user\\nservices, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. In addition, if we are required to or elect to make changes\\nto our marketing and sales or other operations in Hong Kong as a result of the National Security Law, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely\\naffected. It is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising, including in countries where access to our\\nconsumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we generate meaningful revenue from a limited number of resellers representing advertisers\\nbased in China, and it is possible that the Chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertising revenue, whether as a result\\nof the trade dispute with the United States, in response to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other\\naction against us, such as imposing taxes or other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results. Similarly, if we are found to be out of compliance\\nwith  certain  legal  requirements  for  social  media  companies  in  Turkey,  the  Turkish  government  could  take  action  to  reduce  or  eliminate  our  Turkey-based\\nadvertising  revenue  or  otherwise  adversely  impact  access  to  our  products.  In  the  event  that  content  shown  on  Facebook  or  our  other  products  is  subject  to\\ncensorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to or elect to make changes to our operations, or other\\nrestrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing\\ngeographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base, user engagement, or the level of\\nadvertising  by  marketers  may  be  adversely  affected,  we  may  not  be  able  to  maintain  or  grow  our  revenue  as  anticipated,  and  our  financial  results  could  be\\nadversely affected.\\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition,\\nconsumer protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims,\\nchanges to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data use,\\ndata protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and\\ndeletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors,\\nconsumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, anti-corruption and political\\nlaw compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or\\nother actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content,\\ncompetition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are\\nconstantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often\\nuncertain, particularly in the new and\\n34\\nTable of Contents\\nrapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current\\npolicies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent to various\\npractices could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our\\nfinancial results.\\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive certain\\ndata that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For\\nexample, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, called\\nthe Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon\\nwhich Facebook relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example,\\nthe CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought by the Irish\\nData Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, our continued reliance on SCCs is contingent on SCCs being\\nheld to satisfy certain new conditions that are yet to be clearly defined and will be the subject of future regulatory guidance (and the European Commission has\\nrecently proposed new SCCs, which are currently subject to consultation). In addition, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC that\\npreliminarily concluded that Facebook Ireland\\'s reliance on SCCs in respect of European user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily\\nproposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to the United States should therefore be suspended. Facebook Ireland challenged procedural\\naspects of this IDPC inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the Irish High Court in September 2020, and the court ordered the IDPC not to take further steps in\\nrespect of the inquiry until the judicial review proceedings conclude (subject to the IDPC\\'s right to apply to vary or lift this order), which we expect to occur in the\\ncoming months. While we also rely upon alternative legal bases for data transfers, if a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable\\nto continue to rely on SCCs or validly rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United States, we may be unable to operate material\\nportions of our business in Europe as a result of the CJEU\\'s invalidation of the Privacy Shield and any final decision of IDPC, which would materially and\\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have also been managing investigations and lawsuits in Europe, India, and other\\njurisdictions regarding the August 2016 update to WhatsApp\\'s terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other Facebook products and\\nservices, including a lawsuit currently pending before the Supreme Court of India. If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in\\nwhich we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which\\nwe provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results.\\nProposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation\\n(GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for\\ncompanies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union. As a\\nresult, we implemented measures to change our service for minors under the age of 16 for certain countries in Europe that maintain the minimum age of 16 under\\nthe GDPR. We also obtain consent and/or offer new controls to existing and new users in Europe before processing data for certain aspects of our service. In\\naddition, the GDPR requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our designated European privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant\\npenalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. Similarly, the Brazilian General Data Protection Law\\nrecently took effect and imposes data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in Brazil. The California Consumer Privacy Act\\n(CCPA), which took effect in January 2020, also establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users, including more ability to\\ncontrol how their data is shared with third parties. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising\\nservices, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For\\nexample, regulators have recently issued new guidance concerning the ePrivacy Directive\\'s requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies. In\\naddition, effective December 2020, the ePrivacy Directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and includes significant\\npenalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these developments may adversely affect our advertising business.\\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that\\ncould impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing\\ndata protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our\\nservices.\\n35\\nTable of Contents\\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government actions, have in the past led to, and may in\\nthe future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity and\\nreputational harm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business, including fines or demands or\\norders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\\nWe have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and we expect to continue to be subject to such\\nproceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner\\nmaterially adverse to our business.\\nFrom  time  to  time,  we  receive  formal  and  informal  inquiries  from  government  authorities  and  regulators  regarding  our  compliance  with  laws  and\\nregulations, many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests,\\nrequests  for  information,  actions,  and  audits  in  the  United  States,  Europe,  and  around  the  world,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  privacy,  data  protection,  law\\nenforcement, consumer protection, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. In addition, we are currently, and may in the future be,\\nsubject to regulatory orders or consent decrees. For example, data protection, competition, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union and other\\njurisdictions  have  initiated  actions,  investigations,  or  administrative  orders  seeking  to  restrict  the  ways  in  which  we  collect  and  use  information,  or  impose\\nsanctions, and other authorities may do the same. In addition, beginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and other government\\ninquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a\\ndeveloper that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to\\nresolve the FTC inquiry, which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to\\npay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. Beginning in September 2018, we also\\nbecame subject to IDPC and other government inquiries in connection with a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook\\'s code to steal user\\naccess tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. From time to time we also notify the IDPC, our designated European privacy\\nregulator under the GDPR, of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of\\nour regulatory compliance.\\nIn addition, from time to time, we are subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities in the\\nUnited States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our business, including with respect to users and advertisers, as well as our industry.\\nSuch inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital\\nadvertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as past acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an\\nantitrust investigation of our company. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the\\nU.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. House of Representatives, and state attorneys general. In December 2020, the FTC and the attorneys general from 46 states,\\nthe territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed complaints against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we violated\\nantitrust laws by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform, among other things. The lawsuits of\\nthe FTC and attorneys general both seek a permanent injunction against our company\\'s alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including\\ndivestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp.\\nOrders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us\\nto unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a\\nmanner materially adverse to our business, result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our\\nbusiness, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business, and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to\\nvarying degrees from time to time.\\n36\\nTable of Contents\\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, the CCPA, the ePrivacy Directive, and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirements require\\nsignificant operational resources and modifications to our business practices, and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business,\\nreputation, and financial results.\\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified consent order with the FTC, requirements\\nof the GDPR, and other regulatory and legislative requirements around the world, such as the CCPA and the ePrivacy Directive. In particular, we are implementing\\na comprehensive expansion of our privacy program in connection with the FTC consent order, including substantial management and board of directors oversight,\\nstringent operational requirements and reporting obligations, prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a process to regularly certify our\\ncompliance with the privacy program to the FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party assessor, which has been and will\\ncontinue to be challenging and costly to implement. These compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources, and require\\nsignificant new and ongoing investments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We are reallocating resources\\ninternally to assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our other business initiatives. In addition, these efforts\\nrequire substantial modifications to our business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and\\ncostly. As a result, we believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner has been and will continue to be adversely\\naffected. We also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight efforts will require significant time and attention from our management and board of directors.\\nThe requirements of the FTC consent order and other privacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business, and from time to time\\nwe notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues, and we expect to\\ncontinue to do so as any such issues arise in the future. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to\\nsignificant change and uncertain interpretation. If we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the FTC consent order, GDPR,\\nCCPA,  ePrivacy  Directive,  or  other  regulatory  or  legislative  requirements,  or  if  we  are  found  to  be  in  violation  of  the  consent  order  or  other  applicable\\nrequirements, we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations or lawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines, judgments, or other\\npenalties, and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our\\nbusiness, reputation, and financial results.\\nWe may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related\\nto our products, and legislation regulating content on our platform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our\\nbusiness and financial results.\\nWe have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims relating to information or content that is published or made available on our products,\\nincluding our policies and enforcement actions with respect to such information or content. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to\\ndefamation, dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, rights of publicity and privacy, personal\\ninjury torts, laws regulating hate speech or other types of content, and breach of contract, among others. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the\\nUnited States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the\\nUnited States. For example, in April 2019, the European Union passed a directive expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating\\ncertain  uses  of  news  content  online,  which  member  states  are  required  to  implement  by  June  2021.  In  addition,  the  European  Union  revised  the  European\\nAudiovisual Media Service Directive to apply to online video-sharing platforms, which member states are expected to implement by 2021. In the United States,\\nthere have been, and continue to be, various Congressional and executive efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms\\nunder Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, as well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings, counterfeit\\ngoods and copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could\\nincur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. We could also face fines, orders restricting or\\nblocking our services in particular geographies, or other government-imposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in\\nGermany has in the past, and may in the future, result in the imposition of fines for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation,\\nand disclosure obligations. Numerous other countries in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing\\npenalties, including fines, service throttling, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, we have\\nbeen subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in Turkey. In addition, Australia recently\\nannounced proposed legislation that would, among other matters, require us to pay publishers for certain\\n37\\nTable of Contents\\nnews content that is shared on Facebook and Instagram. Content-related legislation also has required us in the past, and may require us in the future, to change our\\nproducts or business practices, increase our compliance costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies. For\\nexample, the European Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent\\nthe  availability  of  that  content,  which  may  require  us  to  make  substantial  investments  in  compliance  processes.  In  addition,  changes  to  Section  230  of  the\\nCommunications Decency Act may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect\\nuser growth and engagement. Any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nPayment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm\\nour business.\\nOur users can purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure on the Facebook website. In\\naddition, certain of our users can use our Payments infrastructure, including on Messenger and WhatsApp, for other activities, such as sending money to other\\nusers and making donations to certain charitable organizations. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere,\\nincluding those governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic\\nfunds transfer, charitable fundraising, and import and export restrictions. Depending on how our Payments product evolves, we may also be subject to other laws\\nand regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and lending. In some jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is\\nnot clear. To increase flexibility in how our use of Payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty, we have received certain money transmitter\\nlicenses in the United States and an Electronic Money (E-money) license that allows us to conduct certain regulated payment activities in the participating member\\ncountries of the European Economic Area, which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas. Our\\nefforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. In\\nthe event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease\\nand desist order, or we may be required to make product changes, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including: increased costs and diversion of management time\\nand effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or customer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers, employees,\\nor third parties; restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and reporting requirements. We have also\\nlaunched certain payments functionality on WhatsApp and have announced plans to develop digital payments products and services, which may subject us to many\\nof the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements.\\nOur participation in the Diem Association subjects us to significant regulatory scrutiny and other risks that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or\\nfinancial results.\\nIn June 2019, we announced our participation in the Diem Association, which will oversee a proposed digital payments system powered by blockchain\\ntechnology, and our plans for Novi, a digital wallet for Diem which we expect to launch as a standalone application and subsequently in Messenger and WhatsApp.\\nDiem is based on relatively new and unproven technology, and the laws and regulations surrounding blockchain-based payments are uncertain and evolving.\\nDiem  has  drawn  significant  scrutiny  from  governments  and  regulators  in  multiple  jurisdictions  and  we  expect  that  scrutiny  to  continue.  As  a  sponsor  of  the\\ninitiative and a proposed digital wallet service provider, we are participating in responses to inquiries from governments and regulators, and adverse government or\\nregulatory actions or negative publicity resulting from such participation may adversely affect our reputation and harm our business.\\nAs this initiative evolves, both Diem and Novi may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions,\\nincluding  those  governing  payments,  financial  services,  anti-money  laundering,  counter-terrorism  financing,  economic  sanctions,  data  protection,  tax,  and\\ncompetition.  In  many  jurisdictions,  the  application  or  interpretation  of  these  laws  and  regulations  is  not  clear,  particularly  with  respect  to  evolving  laws  and\\nregulations that are applied to blockchain and digital payments. To mitigate regulatory uncertainty, Diem has applied for a payment system operator license with\\nthe Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), and Novi has applied for money\\n38\\nTable of Contents\\ntransmitter licenses in the United States and certain other countries, and other financial services licenses in certain other countries, that would allow us to conduct\\ndigital wallet activities in these countries using the Diem network. These licenses, laws, and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations, may\\ndelay or impede the launch of the Diem digital payments system as well as the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require\\nsignificant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business.\\nIn addition, market acceptance of such a digital payments system is subject to significant uncertainty. As such, there can be no assurance that Diem or our\\nassociated products and services will be made available in a timely manner, or at all. We do not have significant prior experience with blockchain-based payments\\ntechnology,  which  may  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  successfully  develop  and  market  these  products  and  services.  We  will  also  incur  increased  costs  in\\nconnection with our participation in the Diem Association and the development and marketing of associated products and services, and our investments may not be\\nsuccessful. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\\nRisks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property\\nSecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, or other cyber incidents could\\nharm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users\\' data or to disrupt our ability to provide service. Our\\nproducts and services involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches\\nand improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information from users, or information from\\nmarketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or other misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish\\nour competitive position. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks), scraping, and general hacking have\\nbecome more prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past, and will occur on our systems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts\\nto create false or undesirable user accounts, purchase ads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading misinformation, or other\\nobjectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types and volume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving\\nnature of our products and services (including our efforts involving new and emerging technologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such\\nbreaches and attacks, including from nation states and highly sophisticated, state-sponsored, or otherwise well-funded actors. Our efforts to address undesirable\\nactivity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user\\nexperience, cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal systems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to\\nprotect our company data or the information we receive, and to disable undesirable activities on our platform, may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or\\nother technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance, including defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors\\' information technology\\nsystems or offerings; government surveillance; breaches of physical security of our facilities or technical infrastructure; or other threats that evolve. In addition,\\nthird parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users\\' data. Cyber-attacks\\ncontinue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have developed systems and\\nprocesses that are designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to prevent or\\ndetect security breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, that we will be able to react in a timely manner, or that our\\nremediation efforts will be successful.\\nIn addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads, may receive or store information provided\\nby us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with Facebook. We provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of\\nservices provided to us. However, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their\\nnetworks, our data or our users\\' data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed.\\nWe experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, and we incur significant costs in protecting against or\\nremediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data\\nprotection, as well as obligations under our modified consent order with the FTC. As a result, affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or\\nregulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of data,\\n39\\nTable of Contents\\nwhich has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our\\nbusiness practices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels. Any of these\\nevents could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, or financial results.\\nFor example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook\\'s code to steal user\\naccess tokens, which were then used to access certain profile information from approximately 29 million user accounts on Facebook. The events surrounding this\\ncyber-attack became the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could subject us to substantial fines and\\ncosts, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\\nIn addition, the changes in our work environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the security of our systems, as well as our ability to\\nprotect against attacks and detect and respond to them quickly. The rapid adoption of some third-party services designed to enable the transition to a remote\\nworkforce also may introduce security risk that is not fully mitigated prior to the use of these services. We may also be subject to increased cyber-attacks, such as\\nphishing attacks by threat actors using the attention placed on the pandemic as a method for targeting our personnel.\\nWe anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify additional instances of misuse of user data or other\\nundesirable activity by third parties on our platform.\\nIn addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making significant investments in privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts to\\ncombat misuse of our services and user data by third parties, including investigations and audits of platform applications. As a result of these efforts we have\\ndiscovered and announced, and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce, additional incidents of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity\\nby third parties. We may not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data or technical limitations, including our lack of visibility over our\\nencrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, challenges related to our personnel working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, the allocation of\\nresources to other projects, or other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy assessor required under our modified\\nconsent order with the FTC, the media, or other third parties. Such incidents and activities have in the past, and may in the future, include the use of user data or\\nour systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper\\nadvertising practices, activities that threaten people\\'s safety on- or offline, or instances of spamming, scraping, data harvesting, unsecured datasets, or spreading\\nmisinformation. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents. Any of the foregoing developments\\nmay negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and brands, require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business,\\nand adversely affect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could\\nsubject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert management\\'s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities in these systems, or failures\\nto address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could adversely affect our business.\\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or maintained internally and/or by third\\nparties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve,\\nprocess,  and manage  immense  amounts  of data.  The  software  and  hardware  on  which  we  rely  has  contained,  and  will  in the  future  contain,  errors,  bugs,  or\\nvulnerabilities,  and  our  systems  are  subject  to  certain  technical  limitations  that  may  compromise  our  ability  to  meet  our  objectives.  Some  errors,  bugs,  or\\nvulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. For example, in\\nSeptember 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook\\'s code to steal user access tokens and access\\ncertain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within the software and hardware\\non which we rely have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products,\\ncompromised ability of our products to perform in a manner consistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, delayed product introductions or enhancements,\\ntargeting, measurement, or billing errors, compromised ability to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property or other data, or reductions in our\\nability to provide some or all of our services. For example, we make commitments to our users as to how their data will\\n40\\nTable of Contents\\nbe used within and across our products, and our systems are subject to errors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments\\nreliably. In addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or\\nmitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users, have in\\nthe past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries,\\nlitigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely\\naffected.\\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third\\nparties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights.\\nIn the United States and internationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property, and we currently hold a\\nsignificant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third\\nparties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark\\nand patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or\\nintend to operate our business. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to\\nenforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or\\nconcepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In addition, we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses\\nand have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses, and we include open source software in our products. As a result of our open\\nsource contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license or disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be\\nmaterial to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or\\nappropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our\\nproducts, services, and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming\\nand, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\\nCompanies in the Internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enter\\ninto  litigation  based  on  allegations  of  infringement,  misappropriation,  or  other  violations  of  intellectual  property  or  other  rights.  In  addition,  various  \"non-\\npracticing entities\" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology\\ncompanies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed, which could\\nincrease our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities.\\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services, or user content, infringe their\\nintellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly\\nhigh profile, we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is\\ncostly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all\\ncases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potential\\npreliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us.\\nSimilarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. The\\nterms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we may\\nhave to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party\\'s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may\\nsignificantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or\\n41\\nTable of Contents\\npractices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense, could\\nresult  in  less  effective  technology  or  practices  or  otherwise  negatively  affect  the  user  experience,  or  may  not  be  feasible.  We  have  experienced  unfavorable\\noutcomes in such disputes and litigation in the past, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an\\nunfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above.\\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our Class A common stock were sold in\\nour initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $17.55 to $304.67 through December 31, 2020. In addition to\\nthe factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous\\nfactors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\\n•\\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results;\\n•\\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these projections;\\n•\\nactions  of  securities  analysts  who  initiate  or  maintain  coverage  of  us,  changes  in  financial  estimates  by  any  securities  analysts  who  follow  our\\ncompany, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\\n•\\nadditional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with acquisitions, or the anticipation of\\nsuch sales;\\n•\\ninvestor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\\n•\\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures,\\nor capital commitments;\\n•\\nannouncements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base, the level of user engagement, or the\\neffectiveness of our ad products;\\n•\\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including our developers and competitors;\\n•\\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\\n•\\nthe inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\\n•\\nmedia coverage of our business and financial performance;\\n•\\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\\n•\\nadverse  government  actions  or  legislative  or  regulatory  developments  relating  to  advertising,  competition,  content,  privacy,  or  other  matters,\\nincluding interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;\\n•\\ntrading activity in our share repurchase program; and\\n•\\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other disruptive external events, or responses to\\nthese events.\\n42\\nTable of Contents\\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity\\nsecurities of many technology companies. We are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of\\ncertain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, as well as the disclosure of our earnings results for the\\nsecond quarter of 2018. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could subject us to substantial\\ncosts, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion\\nof our business and fund our share repurchase program, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may\\nonly receive a return on your investment in our Class A common stock if the trading price of your shares increases.\\nThe dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our\\nCEO and certain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters.\\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders who hold shares of Class B\\ncommon stock, including certain of our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of\\nour outstanding capital stock. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock\\ncollectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for\\napproval  so  long  as the  shares  of  Class  B  common  stock  represent  at  least  9.1%  of  all  outstanding  shares  of  our  Class  A and  Class B  common  stock.  This\\nconcentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such\\nas certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect,\\nover  time,  of  increasing  the  relative  voting  power  of  those  holders  of  Class  B  common  stock  who  retain  their  shares  in  the  long  term.  If,  for  example,\\nMr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control a\\nmajority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\\nOur status as a \"controlled company\" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we are not required to have a majority of\\nour board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could elect\\nnot to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. Accordingly,\\nshould the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to\\nstockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make\\nour Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\\nDelaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby\\ndepressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change\\nin control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an\\ninterested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current restated certificate of incorporation and\\nbylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\\n•\\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the\\n43\\nTable of Contents\\ncombined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a\\nmajority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;\\n•\\nwe currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring\\nstockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\\n•\\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, certain\\namendments  to  our  restated  certificate  of  incorporation  or  bylaws  will  require  the  approval  of  two-thirds  of  the  combined  vote  of  our  then-\\noutstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;\\n•\\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent  less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock,\\nvacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\\n•\\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, our\\nboard of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from\\noffice for cause;\\n•\\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, our\\nstockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;\\n•\\nonly our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of\\nstockholders;\\n•\\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of\\nstockholders;\\n•\\nour restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may be\\nissued, without stockholder approval; and\\n•\\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.\\n44\\nTable of Contents\\nItem 1B.

As of December 31, 2020, we owned and leased approximately 10 million square feet of\\noffice  and building  space  for  our  corporate  headquarters  and  in  the  surrounding  areas,  and  approximately  90  acres  of  land  to  be  developed  to  accommodate\\nanticipated future growth.\\nIn addition, we have offices in more than 80 cities across North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific. We also own 17\\ndata centers globally.\\nWe believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs.\\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere\\nagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with\\nour platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and\\npolicies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United\\nStates against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the\\nsecond quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the\\nNorthern District of California with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019, the\\ndistrict court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to amend. On November 15, 2019, a second amended\\ncomplaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended\\ncomplaint, with leave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. We believe these\\nlawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of\\ncertain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United\\nStates, Europe, and other jurisdictions. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which was approved by\\nthe federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly\\nenhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. Any other government inquiries regarding these matters could subject us to additional\\nsubstantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our\\nbusiness.\\nOn April 1, 2015, a putative class action was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by Facebook users alleging\\nthat the \"tag suggestions\" facial recognition feature violates the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. On\\nApril 16, 2018, the district court certified a class of Illinois residents, and on May 14, 2018, the district court denied both parties\\' motions for summary judgment.\\nOn May 29, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for review of the class certification order and stayed the proceeding. On\\nAugust 8, 2019, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the class certification order. On December 2, 2019, we filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of\\nthe decision of the Ninth Circuit, which was denied. On January 15, 2020, the parties agreed to a settlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit, which provided for a\\npayment of $550 million by us and was subject to court approval. On or about May 8, 2020, the parties executed a formal settlement agreement, and plaintiffs filed\\na motion for preliminary approval of the settlement by the district court. On June 4, 2020, the district court denied the plaintiffs\\' motion without prejudice. On July\\n22, 2020, the parties executed an amended settlement agreement, which, among other terms, provides for a payment of $650 million by us. On August 19, 2020,\\nthe court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to final court approval.\\n45\\nTable of Contents\\nBeginning on September  28, 2018, multiple  putative  class actions were filed  in  state  and federal  courts in  the United States and elsewhere  against  us\\nalleging violations of consumer protection laws and other causes of action in connection with a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook\\'s\\ncode to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. The\\nactions filed in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On November 26, 2019, the district court\\ncertified a class for injunctive relief purposes, but denied certification of a class for purposes of pursuing damages. On January 16, 2020, the parties agreed to a\\nsettlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit. On November 15, 2020, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to final\\ncourt approval. We believe the remaining lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In addition, the events surrounding this cyber-attack\\nbecame the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could subject us to substantial fines and costs,\\nrequire us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\\nFrom time to time we also notify the IDPC, our designated European privacy regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation, of certain other\\npersonal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, in\\nAugust  2020,  we  received  a  preliminary  draft  decision  from  the  IDPC  that  preliminarily  concluded  that  Facebook  Ireland\\'s  reliance  on  Standard  Contractual\\nClauses  in  respect  of  European  user  data  does  not  achieve  compliance  with  the  GDPR  and  preliminarily  proposed  that  such  transfers  of  user  data  from  the\\nEuropean Union to the United States should therefore be suspended. Facebook Ireland challenged procedural aspects of this IDPC inquiry in a judicial review\\ncommenced in the Irish High Court in September 2020, and the court ordered the IDPC not to take further steps in respect of the inquiry until the judicial review\\nproceedings conclude (subject to the IDPC\\'s right to apply to vary or lift this order), which we expect to occur in early 2021. For additional information, see Part I,\\nItem  1A, \"Risk Factors—Our business is subject  to complex  and evolving U.S. and foreign  laws and regulations  regarding  privacy,  data protection,  content,\\ncompetition, consumer protection, and other matters\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any such inquiries or investigations could subject us to substantial\\nfines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\\nIn  addition,  from  time  to  time  we  are  subject  to  various  litigation  and  government  inquiries  and  investigations,  formal  or  informal,  by  competition\\nauthorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in\\nthe areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as past acquisitions. For example, in June\\n2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the\\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of\\nthe Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on\\naccess to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and\\nstate attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against us\\nin the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive  conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act by\\nacquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleges that we violated Section 7\\nof the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The lawsuits of the FTC and attorneys general both seek a permanent injunction against our company\\'s\\nalleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. Multiple putative class\\nactions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection\\nwith these acquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. We believe these lawsuits are without\\nmerit, and we are vigorously defending them. The result of such litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs,\\ninterrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or\\nbehavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.\\nIn addition, from time to time, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in\\nparticular  in Brazil  and  Europe, in  order to  ascertain  the precise  scope of our legal  obligations  to comply  with the  requests of those agencies,  including  our\\nobligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties against us.\\nWe believe we\\n46\\nTable of Contents\\nhave multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.\\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course\\nof business, and we may in the future be subject to additional legal proceedings and disputes.\\nItem 4.

We define FCF as net cash\\nprovided by operating activities reduced by net purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases.\\nWe believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and provides useful information regarding how\\ncash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our business.\\nWe have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better\\nunderstand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with our senior management and board of directors.\\nFCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as\\nnet cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of\\nFCF are:\\n•\\nFCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and\\n•\\nother companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\\nManagement compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of such limitations, presentation of our\\nfinancial  statements  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  and  reconciliation  of  FCF  to  the  most  directly  comparable  GAAP  measure,  net  cash  provided  by  operating\\nactivities, as presented below.\\nThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n2017\\n2016\\n(in millions)\\nNet cash provided by operating activities\\n$\\n38,747 \\n$\\n36,314 \\n$\\n29,274 \\n$\\n24,216 \\n$\\n16,108 \\nLess: Purchases of property and equipment\\n(15,115)\\n(15,102)\\n(13,915)\\n(6,733)\\n(4,491)\\nLess: Principal payments on finance leases\\n(604)\\n(552)\\n— \\n— \\n— \\nFree cash flow\\n$\\n23,028 \\n$\\n20,660 \\n$\\n15,359 \\n$\\n17,483 \\n$\\n11,617 \\n51\\nTable of Contents\\nItem 7. Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the\\nrelated notes included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical\\nconsolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results\\ncould differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed\\nbelow and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of\\ncertain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCertain  revenue  information  in  the  section  entitled  \"—Revenue—Foreign  Exchange  Impact  on  Revenue\"  is  presented  on  a  constant  currency  basis.  This\\ninformation is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2020 using 2019 monthly\\nexchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation\\nor as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. This measure may be different from non‑GAAP\\nfinancial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is\\nprovided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual\\neffect  on  our  operating  results.  We  believe  this  non-GAAP  financial  measure  provides  investors  with  useful  supplemental  information  about  the  financial\\nperformance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and\\nallows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2020 Results\\nOur key community metrics and financial results for 2020 are as follows:\\nCommunity growth:\\n•\\nFacebook daily active users (DAUs) were 1.84 billion on average for December 2020, an increase of 11% year-over-year.\\n•\\nFacebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.80 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 12% year-over-year.\\n•\\nFamily daily active people (DAP) was 2.60 billion on average for December 2020, an increase of 15% year-over-year.\\n•\\nFamily monthly active people (MAP) was 3.30 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\\nFinancial results:\\n•\\nRevenue was $85.97 billion, up 22% year-over-year, and advertising revenue was $84.17 billion, up 21% year-over-year.\\n•\\nTotal costs and expenses were $53.29 billion.\\n•\\nIncome from operations was $32.67 billion and operating margin was 38%.\\n•\\nNet income was $29.15 billion with diluted earnings per share of $10.09.\\n•\\nCapital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $15.72 billion.\\n•\\nEffective tax rate was 12.2%.\\n•\\nCash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $61.95 billion as of December 31, 2020.\\n•\\nHeadcount was 58,604 as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 30% year-over-year.\\nOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic,  we have focused on helping people stay connected,  assisting  the public  health response, and working on the\\neconomic recovery. We have also continued to invest based on the following company priorities: (i) continue making progress on the major social issues facing the\\ninternet and our company, including privacy, safety, and security; (ii) build new experiences that meaningfully improve people\\'s lives today and set the stage for\\neven bigger improvements in the future; (iii) keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses that rely on our\\n52\\nTable of Contents\\nservices to grow and create jobs; and (iv) communicate more transparently about what we\\'re doing and the role our services play in the world.\\nIn 2020, we also continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers where they are\\nand (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective.\\nOur business has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to contain or\\nmitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders. These measures\\nhave caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide, which have significantly impacted\\nour business and results of operations. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user\\nbase across a number of regions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. More recently, we have seen user growth and engagement returning to pre-pandemic\\ntrends, particularly in the United States & Canada region. We are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty,\\nand we expect these trends to continue to be subject to volatility.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also previously caused a reduction in the demand for advertising, as well as a related decline in the pricing of our ads,\\nparticularly in the second quarter of 2020. More recently, we believe the pandemic has contributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce from offline to\\nonline, as well as increasing consumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to services, and we experienced increasing demand for advertising as a result of\\nthese trends. However, it is possible that this increased demand may not continue in future periods and may even recede as the effects of the pandemic subside,\\nwhich could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth. The impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement, the demand for and pricing of our\\nadvertising  services,  as  well  as  on  our  overall  results  of  operations,  remains  highly  uncertain  for  the  foreseeable  future.  In  addition,  we  expect  that  future\\nadvertising revenue growth will continue to be adversely affected by limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory\\nenvironment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers.\\nWe intend to continue to invest in our business based on our company priorities, and we anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity,\\nservers, network infrastructure, and office facilities, as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth, will continue to drive expense growth in 2021. We\\nexpect 2021 capital expenditures to be in the range of $21-23 billion and total expenses to be in the range of $68-73 billion.\\n53\\nTable of Contents\\nTrends in Our Facebook User Metrics\\nThe numbers for our key Facebook metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include users on Instagram, WhatsApp, or our\\nother products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook.\\nTrends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to\\nmarketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures.

Users in India, the Philippines,\\nand Indonesia represented key sources of growth in DAUs during December 2020, relative to the same period in 2019.\\n•\\nMonthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website\\nor a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs\\nare a measure of the size of our global active user community on Facebook.\\n \\n \\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  we  had  2.80  billion  MAUs,  an  increase  of  12%  from  December  31,  2019.  Users  in  India,  Indonesia,  and  the  Philippines\\nrepresented key sources of growth in 2020, relative to the same period in 2019.\\n55\\nTable of Contents\\nTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User Geography\\nWe calculate our revenue by Facebook user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital\\ngoods are purchased, or consumer hardware devices are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the\\naverage of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used\\nin this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. The share of revenue from users who are not also\\nFacebook or Messenger MAUs was not material. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in\\ndifferent geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due\\nto the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2020 in the United States & Canada region was more than 11 times\\nhigher than in the Asia-Pacific region.\\nARPU:\\n$7.37\\n$6.42\\n$7.05\\n$7.26\\n$8.52\\n$6.95\\n$7.05\\n$7.89\\n$10.14\\n \\nARPU: $34.86\\n$30.12\\n$33.27\\n$34.55\\n$41.41\\n$34.18\\n$36.49\\n$39.63\\n$53.56\\nARPU: $10.98\\n$9.55\\n$10.70\\n$10.68\\n$13.21\\n$10.64\\n$11.03\\n$12.41\\n$16.87\\n \\nARPU:\\n$2.96\\n$2.78\\n$3.04\\n$3.24\\n$3.57\\n$3.06\\n$2.99\\n$3.67\\n$4.05\\nARPU:\\n$2.11\\n$1.89\\n$2.13\\n$2.24\\n$2.48\\n$1.99\\n$1.78\\n$2.22\\n$2.77\\nNote: Our revenue by Facebook user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our Facebook users when\\nthey perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is\\ngeographically apportioned based on the billing address of the customer.\\n56\\nTable of Contents\\nOur annual worldwide ARPU in 2020, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $32.03, an increase of 10% from 2019. Over\\nthis period, ARPU increased by 18% in the United States & Canada, 15% in Europe, and 9% in Asia‑Pacific, and ARPU was flat in Rest of World. In addition,\\nuser growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia‑Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be\\nprimarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in\\nany geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.\\n57\\nTable of Contents\\nTrends in Our Family Metrics\\nThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users on our other products unless they\\nwould otherwise qualify as MAP or DAP, respectively, based on their other activities on our Family products.\\nTrends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of\\nour ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active\\npeople (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile devices.\\n•\\nDaily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp\\n(collectively, our \"Family\" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile\\nbrowser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore\\nmust seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques,\\nalgorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by\\nmatching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting\\nsuch group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited\\nsamples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP\\nas a percentage of MAP, as measures of engagement across our products.

While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 4% of our\\nworldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of\\nunique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information, see the section entitled\\n\"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our Family metrics calculations to reflect recent data\\nfrom a periodic WhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates contributed an aggregate of approximately 40 million\\nDAP to our reported worldwide DAP in June 2020.\\nWorldwide DAP increased 15% to 2.60 billion on average during December 2020 from 2.26 billion during December 2019.\\n58\\nTable of Contents\\n•\\nMonthly Active People (MAP).

The share of revenue from users who are not also MAP was not material.\\nARPP:\\n$6.52\\n$5.66\\n$6.20\\n$6.33\\n$7.38\\n$6.03\\n$6.10\\n$6.76\\n$8.62\\nOur annual worldwide ARPP in 2020, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPP during such period, was $27.51, an increase of 8% from 2019.\\n60\\nTable of Contents\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to\\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis,\\nwe  evaluate  our  estimates  and  assumptions  based  on  historical  experience  and  on  various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  are  reasonable  under  the\\ncircumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nAn accounting  policy is deemed to be critical  if the  nature  of the  estimates  or assumptions  is material  due  to the  levels  of subjectivity  and  judgment\\nnecessary  to  account  for  highly  uncertain  matters  or  the  susceptibility  of  such  matters  to  change,  and  the  impact  of  the  estimates  and  assumptions  on  our\\nconsolidated financial statements is material. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs. net in revenue recognition, valuation of\\nequity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets and their associated estimated useful\\nlives have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.\\nFor further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to\\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nIn response to the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with collectibility\\nassessment of revenue and credit losses of accounts receivable could have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements in future periods, depending\\non the duration or degree of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy. \\nCollectibility Assessment of Revenue\\nUnder Topic 606, we recognize revenue using a five-step model. In step one, for a revenue contract to exist, it must be probable that substantially all of the\\nconsideration to which we are entitled to will be collected. In performing such collectibility assessment, we consider various facts and circumstances including\\nfuture expectations about our customer\\'s ability and intention to pay. Collectibility assessment uses a probable threshold which requires estimation based on several\\nobjective and subjective factors, such as probability of default, customer’s intention to pay, payment history, financial strength, geography, and industry sub-\\nvertical risks. The collectibility assessment has become uncertain during the current economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our actual\\nexperience in the future may differ from our past experiences or current assessment.\\nCredit Losses of Accounts Receivable\\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\\nLosses on Financial Instruments, which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost that an entity\\ndoes not expect to collect over the asset\\'s contractual life, considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic\\nconditions.\\nFor accounts receivable measured at amortized cost, we use aging analysis, probability of default methods and incorporate macroeconomic variables that are\\nmost relevant to evaluating and estimating the expected credit losses. These macroeconomic variables may vary by geography, customer-type, or industry sub-\\nvertical. The contractual life of our trade accounts receivable is generally short-term; however, we may experience increasing credit loss risks from accounts\\nreceivable in future periods depending on the duration or degree of economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our actual experience in the\\nfuture may differ from our past experiences or current assessment.\\nGross vs. Net in Revenue Recognition\\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-party publishers, there is significant judgment in evaluating whether we are the principal, and\\nreport revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or\\nservices before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion\\nin\\n61\\nTable of Contents\\nestablishing price. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenue recognized\\non the consolidated statements of income.\\nValuation of Equity Investments\\nFor our equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative, determining whether an equity security\\nissued by the same issuer is similar to the equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated with\\nthe instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable price for differences such\\nas, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most advantageous markets. In addition, the identification of observable\\ntransactions  will  depend  on  the  timely  reporting  of  these  transactions  from  our  investee  companies,  which  may  occur  in  a  period  subsequent  to  when  the\\ntransactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually\\noccurred. For equity investments, we perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The\\nqualitative  assessment  considers  factors  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,  the  investee\\'s  financial  condition  and  business  outlook;  industry  and  sector  performance;\\nregulatory,  economic  or technological  environment;  operational  and financing  cash  flows;  and other  relevant  events  and  factors  affecting  the  investee.  When\\nindicators  of  impairment  exist,  we  estimate  the  fair  value  of  our  equity  investments  using  the  market  approach  and/or  the  income  approach  and  recognize\\nimpairment loss in the consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Estimating fair value requires judgment and use\\nof estimates such as discount rates, forecast cash flows, holding period, and market data of comparable companies, among others.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for\\nincome taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination\\nby the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been\\ndeveloped based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are\\nbased on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we\\nbelieve that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax\\noutcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when\\nfacts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is\\ndifferent from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have\\na material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.\\nCertain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various\\nlegal and regulatory obligations around the world. The requirements  for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation  and\\nenforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With\\nrespect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both\\nprobable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and\\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and\\nrelated  reasonably  possible  losses  disclosed.  We  make  adjustments  to  our  provisions  and  changes  to  our  disclosures  accordingly  to  reflect  the  impact  of\\nnegotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel,\\n62\\nTable of Contents\\nand  updated  information.  Significant  judgment  is  required  to  determine  the  probability  of  loss  and  the  estimated  amount  of  loss,  including  when  and  if  the\\nprobability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters.\\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable or if and when the reasonably\\npossible  range  of  loss  is  estimable,  is  inherently  uncertain.  Therefore,  if  one  or  more  of  these  matters  were  resolved  against  us  for  amounts  in  excess  of\\nmanagement\\'s estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes\\nprobable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 12—Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15—Income Taxes of the accompanying\\nnotes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\"\\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.\\nValuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Estimated Useful Lives\\nWe  allocate  the  fair  value  of  purchase  consideration  to  the  tangible  assets  acquired,  liabilities  assumed,  and  intangible  assets  acquired  based  on  their\\nestimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\\nSuch valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing\\ncertain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology,\\nacquired patents, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management\\'s estimates of fair value are based upon\\nassumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of\\npurchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful\\nlife, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the\\nacquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the\\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\\nWe review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair\\nvalue of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of December 31, 2020, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate\\nthat the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely\\nindependent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future\\nundiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and\\nequipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairment\\ncharges during the years presented.\\nThe useful lives of our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are determined by management when those\\nassets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. The current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate\\nbased on current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business\\noperations,  changes  in  the  planned  use  of  assets,  and  technological  advancements.  When  we  change  the  estimated  useful  life  assumption  for  any  asset,  the\\nremaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life. Historically changes in\\nuseful lives have not resulted in material changes to our depreciation and amortization expense.\\n63\\nTable of Contents\\nComponents of Results of Operations\\nRevenue\\nAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook,\\nInstagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with\\nadvertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users.\\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered\\ndelivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer\\ncontracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products.\\nWe calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless\\nof their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\\nOther  revenue. Other  revenue  consists  of  revenue  from  the  delivery  of  consumer  hardware  devices,  net  fees  we  receive  from  developers  using  our\\nPayments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\\nCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses\\nCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses\\nrelated to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based\\ncompensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements,\\nincluding traffic acquisition and content costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, and cost of consumer hardware\\ndevices sold.\\nResearch  and  development. Research  and  development  expenses  consist  primarily  of  salaries  and  benefits,  share-based  compensation,  and  facilities-\\nrelated costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products.\\nMarketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries and benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales,\\nsales  support,  marketing,  business  development,  and  customer  service  functions.  Our  marketing  and  sales  expenses  also  include  marketing  and  promotional\\nexpenditures and professional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations.\\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of legal-related costs; salaries and benefits, and share-based compensation for\\ncertain  of  our  executives  as  well  as  our  legal,  finance,  human  resources,  corporate  communications  and  policy,  and  other  administrative  employees;  and\\nprofessional services.\\nResults of Operations\\nIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. For a\\ndiscussion of the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, please refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and\\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\\n64\\nTable of Contents\\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\nRevenue\\n$\\n85,965 \\n$\\n70,697 \\n$\\n55,838 \\nCosts and expenses:\\n \\nCost of revenue\\n16,692 \\n12,770 \\n9,355 \\nResearch and development\\n18,447 \\n13,600 \\n10,273 \\nMarketing and sales\\n11,591 \\n9,876 \\n7,846 \\nGeneral and administrative\\n6,564 \\n10,465 \\n3,451 \\nTotal costs and expenses\\n53,294 \\n46,711 \\n30,925 \\nIncome from operations\\n32,671 \\n23,986 \\n24,913 \\nInterest and other income, net\\n509 \\n826 \\n448 \\nIncome before provision for income taxes\\n33,180 \\n24,812 \\n25,361 \\nProvision for income taxes\\n4,034 \\n6,327 \\n3,249 \\nNet income\\n$\\n29,146 \\n$\\n18,485 \\n$\\n22,112 \\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue)\\n:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\nRevenue\\n100 %\\n100 %\\n100 %\\nCosts and expenses:\\nCost of revenue\\n19 \\n18 \\n17 \\nResearch and development\\n21 \\n19 \\n18 \\nMarketing and sales\\n13 \\n14 \\n14 \\nGeneral and administrative\\n8 \\n15 \\n6 \\nTotal costs and expenses\\n62 \\n66 \\n55 \\nIncome from operations\\n38 \\n34 \\n45 \\nInterest and other income, net\\n1 \\n1 \\n1 \\nIncome before provision for income taxes\\n39 \\n35 \\n45 \\nProvision for income taxes\\n5 \\n9 \\n6 \\nNet income\\n34 %\\n26 %\\n40 %\\n_________________________\\n(1)\\nPercentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded results.\\nShare-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31, \\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\nCost of revenue\\n$\\n447 \\n$\\n377 \\n$\\n284 \\nResearch and development\\n4,918 \\n3,488 \\n3,022 \\nMarketing and sales\\n691 \\n569 \\n511 \\nGeneral and administrative\\n480 \\n402 \\n335 \\nTotal share-based compensation expense\\n$\\n6,536 \\n$\\n4,836 \\n$\\n4,152 \\n \\n(1)\\n65\\nTable of Contents\\nShare-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses (as a percentage of revenue)\\n:\\n \\nYear Ended December 31,\\n \\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\nCost of revenue\\n1 %\\n1 %\\n1 %\\nResearch and development\\n6 \\n5 \\n5 \\nMarketing and sales\\n1 \\n1 \\n1 \\nGeneral and administrative\\n1 \\n1 \\n1 \\nTotal share-based compensation expense\\n8 %\\n7 %\\n7 %\\n_________________________\\n(1)\\nPercentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded results.\\nRevenue\\n \\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020 vs 2019 % Change\\n2019 vs 2018 % Change\\n \\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n \\n(in millions)\\n \\n \\nAdvertising\\n$\\n84,169 \\n$\\n69,655 \\n$\\n55,013 \\n21 %\\n27 %\\nOther revenue\\n1,796 \\n1,042 \\n825 \\n72 %\\n26 %\\nTotal revenue\\n$\\n85,965 \\n$\\n70,697 \\n$\\n55,838 \\n22 %\\n27 %\\n \\n2020 Compared to 2019. Revenue in 2020 increased $15.27 billion, or 22%, compared to 2019. The increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising\\nrevenue as a result of an increase in the number of ads delivered, partially offset by a decrease in the average price per ad.\\nIn 2020, the number of ads delivered increased by 34%, as compared with approximately 33% in 2019. The increase in the ads delivered was driven by an\\nincrease in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products, and an increase in users. In 2020, the average price per ad decreased by 10%, as\\ncompared with a decrease of approximately 5% in 2019. The decrease in average price per ad during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by a\\ndecrease in advertising demand globally during the first two quarters of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and, to a lesser extent, by an increasing proportion of\\nthe number of ads delivered as Stories ads and in geographies that monetize at lower rates.\\nIn the near-term, we anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be determined primarily by several factors: the extent to which we continue to see\\nincreasing advertising demand in connection with the shift of commerce from offline to online, as well as increased consumer demand for purchasing products as\\nopposed to services, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; the status of the economic recovery from the slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the\\nmagnitude of fiscal stimulus; and the extent to which changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers result in\\nlimitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools.\\nAdvertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. We believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our\\nquarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending\\nbetween the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our advertising revenue increased 28%, 19%, and 23% between the third and fourth quarters of\\n2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 declined 16% and 10% compared to the fourth quarters\\nof 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenue\\nThe  general  strengthening  of  the  U.S.  dollar  relative  to  certain  foreign  currencies  in  the  full  year  2020  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2019,  had  an\\nunfavorable impact on revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2020 using the prior year\\'s monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing\\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and\\n(1)\\n66\\nTable of Contents\\nadvertising revenue would have been $86.08 billion and $84.30 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have\\nbeen $120 million and $129 million, respectively, higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2020. Using the same constant rates,\\nfull  year  2020  total  revenue  and  advertising  revenue  would  have  been  $15.39  billion  and  $14.64  billion,  respectively,  higher  than  actual  total  revenue  and\\nadvertising revenue for the full year 2019.\\nCost of revenue\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n2020 vs 2019 %\\nChange\\n2019 vs 2018 %\\nChange\\n(dollars in millions)\\nCost of revenue\\n$\\n16,692 \\n$\\n12,770 \\n$\\n9,355 \\n31 %\\n37%\\nPercentage of revenue\\n19%\\n18%\\n17%\\n2020 Compared to 2019. Cost of revenue in 2020 increased  $3.92 billion, or 31%, compared to 2019. The increase was mostly due to an increase in\\noperational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, higher cost associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition and\\ncontent costs and, to a lesser extent, an increase in cost of consumer hardware devices sold.\\nIn 2021, we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user\\ngrowth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and services and, to a lesser extent, due to higher costs associated with partner arrangements\\nand consumer hardware devices.\\nResearch and development\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n2020 vs 2019 %\\nChange\\n2019 vs 2018 %\\nChange\\n(dollars in millions)\\nResearch and development\\n$\\n18,447 \\n$\\n13,600 \\n$\\n10,273 \\n36 %\\n32 %\\nPercentage of revenue\\n21%\\n19%\\n18%\\n \\n2020 Compared to 2019. Research and development expenses in 2020 increased $4.85 billion, or 36%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to\\nincreases in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 40% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 in engineering and\\nother technical functions supporting our continued investment in our Family of products and consumer hardware products.\\nIn  2021,  we  plan  to  continue  to  hire  software  engineers  and  other  technical  employees,  and  to  increase  our  investment  to  support  our  research  and\\ndevelopment initiatives.\\nMarketing and sales\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n2020 vs 2019 %\\nChange\\n2019 vs 2018 %\\nChange\\n(dollars in millions)\\nMarketing and sales\\n$\\n11,591 \\n$\\n9,876 \\n$\\n7,846 \\n17 %\\n26%\\nPercentage of revenue\\n13%\\n14%\\n14%\\n2020 Compared to 2019. Marketing and sales expenses in 2020 increased $1.72 billion, or 17%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily driven by\\nincreases in marketing expenses and payroll and benefits expenses, which were partially offset by a decrease in travel-related expenses due to the COVID-19\\npandemic. Our payroll and benefits expenses increased as a result of a 16% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 in our\\nmarketing and sales functions.\\n67\\nTable of Contents\\nIn  2021,  we  plan  to  continue  the  hiring  of  marketing  and  sales  employees  to  support  our  marketing,  sales,  and  partnership  efforts,  and  we  anticipate\\nmarketing expenses will increase.\\nGeneral and administrative\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n2020 vs 2019 %\\nChange\\n2019 vs 2018 %\\nChange\\n(dollars in millions)\\nLegal accrual related to FTC settlement\\n$\\n— \\n$\\n5,000 \\n$\\n— \\nNM\\nNM\\nOther general and administrative\\n6,564 \\n5,465 \\n3,451 \\n20 %\\n58 %\\nGeneral and administrative\\n$\\n6,564 \\n$\\n10,465 \\n$\\n3,451 \\n(37) %\\n203 %\\nPercentage of revenue\\n8%\\n15%\\n6%\\n \\n2020  Compared  to  2019.

Our provision for income taxes in 2020 decreased $2.29 billion, or 36%, compared to 2019, mostly due to the additional tax\\nexpense incurred in 2019 from the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion and the effects of a tax election to capitalize and amortize certain research and development\\nexpenses for U.S. income tax purposes, both discussed below.\\nOur effective tax rate in 2020 decreased compared to 2019, primarily due to the 2019 legal accrual related to the FTC settlement that was not tax-deductible,\\nthe additional tax expense incurred in 2019 from the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion, and the effects of a tax election to capitalize and amortize certain research and\\ndevelopment expenses for U.S. income tax purposes.\\nIn  the  third  quarter  of  2020,  as  part  of  finalizing  our  U.S.  income  tax  return,  we  elected  to  capitalize  and  amortize  certain  research  and  development\\nexpenses for U.S. income tax purposes. As a result, we recorded a total of $1.07 billion\\n68\\nTable of Contents\\nincome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020. The income tax benefit resulted from recording a deferred income tax asset that was greater than the\\ncurrent income tax liability due to different tax rates applicable for the periods in which capitalized expenses will be amortized versus the period in which the\\nincreased current tax liability was accrued. We do not believe this election will materially affect our effective tax rate trend in the future.\\nOn July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court issued a decision (Tax Court Decision) in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, which concluded that related parties\\nin a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to share-based compensation. The Tax Court Decision was appealed by the Commissioner\\nto the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit). On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion (Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion) that reversed the Tax\\nCourt Decision. Based on the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion, we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of $1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2019. On July\\n22, 2019, the taxpayer requested a rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit and the request was denied on November 12, 2019. The taxpayer requested a hearing\\nbefore the Supreme Court of the United States and the request was denied on June 22, 2020. Since we started to accrue income tax for share-based compensation\\ncost-sharing expense in the second quarter of 2019, the denial of the request by the Supreme Court did not have a material impact to our financial results in 2020.\\nEffective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision for\\nincome taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign derived intangible income, tax effects from share-based compensation, tax effects of integrating intellectual property\\nfrom acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of changes in tax law.\\nThe  accounting  for  share-based  compensation  may  increase  or  decrease  our  effective  tax  rate  based  upon  the  difference  between  our  share-based\\ncompensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price\\nremains constant to the January 22, 2021 price, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year of 2021 will be in the high-teens.\\nIntegrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our\\nprovision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and\\nintegration. The magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative\\ncontribution to income in subsequent periods.\\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits. As of December 31, 2020, we had net unrecognized tax benefits of $3.48 billion which were accrued as other liabilities. These\\nunrecognized  tax  benefits  were  predominantly  accrued  for  uncertainties  related  to  transfer  pricing  with  our  foreign  subsidiaries,  which  includes  licensing  of\\nintellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits. The ultimate settlement of the liabilities\\nwill depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigation\\ndescribed below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such amounts within the next 12 months.\\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with\\nthe examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent\\nto 2010. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS filed its\\nPretrial Memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first sessions of\\nthe trial began in February 2020, and additional sessions are expected to continue in 2021. The IRS did not provide any information about how it intends to apply\\nthe revised adjustment to future years. Based on the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an\\nadditional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return,\\nplus interest and any penalties asserted.\\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its\\nposition from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain\\ntax  credits  that  we  claimed.  If  the  IRS  prevails  in  its  position  for  these  new  adjustments,  this  could  result  in  an  additional  federal  tax  liability  of  up  to\\napproximately $680 million\\n69\\nTable of Contents\\nin excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second\\nNotice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.\\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes, that is lower than the potential\\nadditional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions\\nrelated to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under\\nthe mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). As of December 31, 2020, we have not resolved\\nthese matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.\\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or\\nother tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is\\nreasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining that\\nare subject to examination in various jurisdictions, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax\\nbenefits. If the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse effect\\non our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\\n70\\nTable of Contents\\nQuarterly Results of Operations Data\\nThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the\\neight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2020.

securities, and cash generated from operations. Cash and cash equivalents\\nand marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in U.S. government securities, U.S.\\ngovernment agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $61.95 billion as of December 31, 2020, an\\nincrease of $7.10 billion from December 31, 2019. The increase was mostly due to $38.75 billion of cash generated from operations, offset by $15.72 billion for\\ncapital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, $6.36 billion for purchases of equity investments, $6.27 billion for repurchases of our Class A\\ncommon stock, and $3.56 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock units (RSU) awards.\\nCash paid for income taxes was $4.23 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our federal net operating loss carryforward\\nwas $10.62 billion and our federal tax credit carryforward was $424 million. We anticipate the utilization of a significant portion of these net operating losses and\\ncredits within the next three years.\\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an\\nexpiration date. As of December 31, 2019, $4.90 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases under this program. In 2020, we repurchased and\\nsubsequently retired 27 million shares of our Class A common stock for $6.30 billion. As of December 31, 2020, $8.60 billion remained available and authorized\\nfor repurchases. In January 2021, an additional $25 billion of repurchases was authorized under this program.\\nAs of December 31, 2020, $7.18 billion of the $61.95 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries.\\nThe Tax Act imposed a mandatory  transition  tax on accumulated  foreign  earnings and eliminated  U.S. taxes on foreign  subsidiary distributions.  As a result,\\nearnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes.\\nIn July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the inquiry of the FTC into our platform and user data practices, which was\\napproved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. We paid the penalty of $5.0 billion in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consent order.\\nOn April 21, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to invest in Jio Platforms Limited, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited. The transaction closed on\\nJuly 7, 2020, and we paid approximately $5.8 billion at the then-current exchange rate.\\nWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share\\nrepurchase program for the foreseeable future.\\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\\nCash flow from operating activities during 2020 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including $6.86 billion of depreciation\\nand amortization and $6.54 billion of share-based compensation expense, and offset by a cash payment of $5.0 billion for the FTC legal settlement. The increase in\\ncash flow from operating activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was mostly due to higher net income as adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation\\nand\\n73\\nTable of Contents\\namortization, share-based compensation expense and deferred income tax, partially offset by the payment of $5.0 billion for the FTC legal settlement.\\nCash  flow  from  operating  activities  during  2019  primarily  consisted  of  net  income,  adjusted  for  certain  non-cash  items,  including  $5.74  billion  of\\ndepreciation and amortization and $4.84 billion of share-based compensation expense. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2019 compared\\nto 2018 was primarily due to higher net income prior to the effect of the $5.0 billion FTC legal settlement accrual, an increase in taxes payable as well as increases\\nin the non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, and share-based compensation expense.\\nCash Used in Investing Activities\\nCash used in investing activities during 2020 mostly resulted from $15.11 billion of purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in data\\ncenters,  servers,  office  facilities,  and  network  infrastructure,  $8.16  billion  of  net  purchases  of marketable  securities,  and  $6.36 billion  of purchases  of equity\\ninvestments. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was due to increases in purchases of equity investments and in net\\npurchases of marketable securities.\\nCash used in investing activities during 2019 mostly resulted from $15.10 billion of net purchase of property and equipment as we continued to invest in\\ndata centers, servers, network infrastructure, and $4.19 billion of net purchases of marketable securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during\\n2019 compared to 2018 was mostly due to increases in the net purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment.\\nWe anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $21 billion to $23 billion in 2021.\\nCash Used in Financing Activities\\nCash used in financing activities during 2020 mostly consisted of $6.27 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and $3.56 billion of taxes paid\\nrelated to net share settlement of RSUs. The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was due to increases in repurchases of our\\nClass A common stock and in taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs.\\nCash used in financing activities during 2019 mostly consisted of $4.20 billion used to settle repurchases of our Class A common stock, and $2.34 billion of\\ntaxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $552 million of principal payments on finance leases. The decrease in cash used in financing\\nactivities during 2019 compared to 2018 was mostly due to a decrease in repurchases of our Class A common stock.\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our\\nfinancial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\\n74\\nTable of Contents\\nContractual Obligations\\nOur principal commitments consist mostly of obligations under operating leases and other contractual commitments. Our obligations under operating leases\\ninclude  among  others,  certain  of  our  offices,  data  centers,  land,  colocations,  and  equipment.  Our  other  contractual  commitments  are  mostly  related  to  our\\ninvestments in network infrastructure, consumer hardware, content costs, and data center operations. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle\\ncontractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2020:\\nPayment Due by Period \\nTotal\\n2021\\n2022-2023\\n2024-2025\\nThereafter\\n(in millions)\\nOperating lease obligations, including imputed interest\\n$\\n20,751 \\n$\\n1,316 \\n$\\n3,017 \\n$\\n3,065 \\n$\\n13,353 \\nFinance lease obligations, including imputed interest\\n1,088 \\n249 \\n214 \\n100 \\n525 \\nTransition tax payable\\n1,543 \\n— \\n300 \\n1,243 \\n— \\nOther contractual commitments\\n7,504 \\n4,213 \\n1,071 \\n244 \\n1,976 \\nTotal contractual obligations\\n$\\n30,886 \\n$\\n5,778 \\n$\\n4,602 \\n$\\n4,652 \\n$\\n15,854 \\n_________________________\\n(1)\\nIncludes variable lease payments that were fixed subsequent to lease commencement or modification.\\nAdditionally, as part of the normal course of the business, we may also enter into multi-year agreements to purchase renewable energy that do not specify a\\nfixed or minimum volume commitment. These agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either volume or price. Using projected market prices or\\nexpected volume consumption, the total estimated spend is approximately $4.94 billion. The ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on\\nprevailing market prices or actual volume purchased.\\nOur other liabilities also include $3.48 billion related to net uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the\\ncompletion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of\\npayments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.\\nContingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We record a liability when we believe that it is\\nboth probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may\\nincur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the\\nextent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and\\nsubject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could\\nhave a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\\nSee  Note  12—Commitments  and  Contingencies  and  Note  15—Income  Taxes  in the  notes  to our  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  Part  II,\\nItem 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information\\nregarding contingencies.\\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\\nFor further information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying\\nnotes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n(1)\\n(1)\\n75\\nTable of Contents\\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity investment risk, and inflation.\\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro.\\nAccordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue\\nand other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.\\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing monetary\\nasset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have\\nnot entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is\\ndifficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Foreign currency losses of $129 million, $105 million, and $213 million\\nwere recognized in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, as interest and other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income.\\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\\nOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.\\nOur  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  consist  of  cash,  certificates  of  deposit,  time  deposits,  money  market  funds,  U.S.  government\\nsecurities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of\\ncapital  and  supporting  our  liquidity  requirements.  Changes  in  U.S.  interest  rates  affect  the  interest  earned  on  our  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  marketable\\nsecurities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $794 million and\\n$525 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Any realized gains or\\nlosses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.\\nEquity Investment Risk\\nOur equity investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our holdings. We\\ncontinually evaluate our equity investments in privately-held companies.\\nOur equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily determinable market values. We elected to account\\nfor  most  of  our  equity  investments  using  the  measurement  alternative,  which  is  cost,  less  any  impairment,  adjusted  for  changes  in  fair  value  resulting  from\\nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether\\nthere are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee\\'s financial condition and business\\noutlook; industry and sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. Valuations of our\\nequity investments are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable transactions. Volatility in the global economic climate and financial\\nmarkets, including recent and ongoing effects related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires significant judgments, could result in a material\\nimpairment  charge  on  our  equity  investments.  Equity  investments  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  were  immaterial  as  of  December  31,  2020  and\\nDecember 31, 2019. Our equity investments had a carrying value of $6.23 billion as of December 31, 2020.\\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 5 — Equity Investments, and\\nNote 6 — Fair Value Measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, and \"Financial Statements and Supplementary\\nData\"  and  Part  II,  Item  7,  \"Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Conditions  and  Results  of  Operations  —  Critical  Accounting  Policies  and\\nEstimates\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n76\\nTable of Contents\\nItem 8.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated\\nstatements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders\\' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the\\nrelated notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material\\nrespects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the\\nperiod ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\\'s internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated January 27, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nAdoption of ASU No. 2016-02\\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption of\\nAccounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and the related amendments.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\'s financial statements\\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance\\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable\\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe\\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to\\nbe communicated to the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)\\ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the\\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical\\naudit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\\n78\\nTable of Contents\\nLoss Contingencies\\nDescription of the Matter\\nAs described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, and\\nregulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable\\nand the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss\\nin some of these cases, actions or inquiries described above. For certain of these matters, the Company discloses an estimate of\\nthe amount of loss or range of possible loss that may be incurred. However, for certain other matters, the Company discloses that\\nthe amount of such losses or a range of possible losses cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\\nAuditing  the  Company\\'s  accounting  for,  and  disclosure  of,  loss  contingencies  related  to  the  various  legal  proceedings  was\\nespecially challenging due to the significant judgment required to evaluate management\\'s assessments of the likelihood of a loss,\\nand their estimate of the potential amount or range of such losses.\\nHow We Addressed the Matter\\nin Our Audit\\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification and\\nevaluation of these matters, including controls relating to the Company\\'s assessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realized\\nand their ability to reasonably estimate the potential range of possible losses.\\nTo test the Company\\'s assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss, whether the loss was reasonably estimable, and the\\nconclusion and disclosure regarding any range of possible losses, including when the Company believes it cannot be reasonably\\nestimated at this time, we read the minutes or a summary of the meetings of the committees of the board of directors, read the\\nproceedings,  claims,  and  regulatory,  or  government  inquiries  and  investigations,  or  summaries  as  we  deemed  appropriate,\\nrequested and received internal and external legal counsel confirmation letters, met with internal and external legal counsel to\\ndiscuss the nature of the various matters, and obtained representations from management. We also evaluated the appropriateness\\nof the related disclosures included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\\n79\\nTable of Contents\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nDescription of the Matter\\nAs discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has received certain notices from the Internal\\nRevenue  Service  (IRS)  related  to  transfer  pricing  agreements  with  the  Company\\'s  foreign  subsidiaries  for  certain  periods\\nexamined. The IRS has stated that it will also apply its position to tax years subsequent to those examined. If the IRS prevails in\\nits  position,  it  could  result  in  an  additional  federal  tax  liability,  plus  interest  and  any  penalties  asserted.  The  Company  uses\\njudgment to (1) determine whether a tax position\\'s technical merits are more-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measure the\\namount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.\\nAuditing the Company\\'s accounting for, and disclosure of, these uncertain tax positions was especially challenging due to the\\nsignificant judgment required to assess management\\'s evaluation of technical merits and the measurement of the tax position\\nbased on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\\nHow We Addressed the Matter\\nin Our Audit\\nWe  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  controls  over  the  Company\\'s\\nprocess to assess the technical merits of tax positions related to these transfer pricing agreements and to measure the benefit of\\nthose tax positions.\\nAs part of our audit procedures over the Company\\'s accounting for these positions, we involved our tax professionals to assist\\nwith  our  assessment  of  the  technical  merits  of  the  Company\\'s  tax  positions.  This  included  assessing  the  Company\\'s\\ncorrespondence  with  the  relevant  tax  authorities,  evaluating  income  tax  opinions  or  other  third-party  advice  obtained  by  the\\nCompany,  and  requesting  and  receiving  confirmation  letters  from  third-party  advisors.  We  also  used  our  knowledge  of,  and\\nexperience with, the application of international and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate the\\nCompany\\'s accounting for those tax positions. We analyzed the Company\\'s assumptions and data used to determine the amount\\nof the federal tax liability recognized and tested the mathematical accuracy of the underlying data and calculations. We also\\nevaluated the appropriateness of the related disclosures included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in relation to\\nthese matters.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nWe have served as the Company\\'s auditor since 2007.\\nRedwood City, California\\nJanuary 27, 2021\\n80\\nTable of Contents\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Facebook, Inc.\\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nWe have audited Facebook, Inc.\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated\\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Facebook,\\nInc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance\\nsheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders\\' equity and cash\\nflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated January 27, 2021 expressed an unqualified\\nopinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThe Company\\'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\\'s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express\\nan opinion on the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\\nrequired  to  be  independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance\\nabout whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating\\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the\\ncircumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nA company\\'s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\'s internal control over financial\\nreporting  includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the\\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\\nfinancial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in\\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\'s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of\\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nRedwood City, California\\nJanuary 27, 2021\\n81\\nTable of Contents\\nFACEBOOK, INC.\\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nOrganization and Description of Business\\nFacebook was incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. We\\ngenerate substantially all of our revenue from advertising.\\nBasis of Presentation\\nWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The consolidated financial\\nstatements include the accounts of Facebook, Inc., its subsidiaries where we have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for which we are\\ndeemed to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year\\'s presentation. None of these reclassifications had a material impact to\\nour consolidated financial statements.\\nUse of Estimates\\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in\\nthe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and\\nliabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other assumptions that\\nwe believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those related\\nto revenue recognition, valuation of equity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets\\nand their associated estimated useful lives, collectibility of accounts receivable, credit losses of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, fair value of financial\\ninstruments, and leases. These estimates are based on management\\'s knowledge about current events and expectations about actions we may undertake in the\\nfuture. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created and may continue to create significant uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions, which may cause further business\\nslowdowns or shutdowns, depress demand for our advertising business, and adversely impact our results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020,\\nwe faced uncertainties around our estimates of revenue collectibility and accounts receivable credit losses. We expect uncertainties around our key accounting\\nestimates to continue to evolve depending on the duration and degree of impact associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our estimates may change as new events\\noccur and additional information emerges, and such changes are recognized or disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect\\nto be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\\nWe determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:\\n•\\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\\n•\\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\\n•\\ndetermination of the transaction price;\\n•\\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\\n•\\nrecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\\nRevenue excludes sales and usage‑based taxes where it has been determined that we are acting as a pass‑through agent.\\n88\\nTable of Contents\\nAdvertising\\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications.\\nMarketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or\\nthe number of actions, such as clicks, taken by our users.\\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered\\ndelivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer\\ncontracted for. In general, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our\\ncontrol is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. For revenue generated from arrangements\\nthat involve third-party publishers, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent, and for those advertising revenue arrangements where we are the agent,\\nwe recognize revenue on a net basis.\\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and certain customers may receive cash-\\nbased incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these\\namounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenue. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of\\nvariable consideration.\\nOther Revenue\\nOther revenue consists of revenue from the delivery of Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) consumer hardware devices, net fees we receive from developers using\\nour Payments infrastructure, as well as revenue from various other sources.\\nDeferred Revenue and Deposits\\nDeferred  revenue  mostly  consists  of  billings  and  payments  we  receive  from  marketers  in  advance  of  revenue  recognition  as  well  as  revenue  not  yet\\nrecognized for unspecified software upgrades and updates for various FRL products. Deposits relate to unused balances held on behalf of our users who primarily\\nuse these balances to make purchases in games on our platform. Once this balance is utilized by a user, the majority of this amount would then be payable to the\\ndeveloper and the balance would be recognized as revenue. The increase in the deferred revenue balance for the year ended December 31, 2020 was driven by cash\\npayments from customers  in advance  of satisfying  our performance  obligations  in FRL sales and advertising  revenue,  offset  by revenue  recognized  that was\\nincluded in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period.\\nOur payment terms vary by the products or services offered. The term between billings and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or\\nservices and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\\nWe generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within\\nmarketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income.\\nWe do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts\\nfor which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.\\nCost of Revenue\\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the\\noperation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for\\nemployees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic\\nacquisition\\n89\\nTable of Contents\\nand content costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, and cost of consumer hardware devices sold.\\nContent Costs\\nOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform. For\\nlicensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that\\nmeet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\\nFor  licensed  music,  we  expense  the  license  fees  over  the  contractual  license  period.  Expensed  content  costs  are  included  in  cost  of  revenue  on  the\\nconsolidated statements of income.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed or sold to external users,\\nare expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services.\\nThese software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be\\ncompleted and the software will be used to perform the function intended.\\nDevelopment costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for\\nincome taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under\\nthis method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting\\nand tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are\\nexpected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income\\ntax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment.\\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all\\navailable evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and\\nongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination\\nby the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been\\ndeveloped based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are\\nbased on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we\\nbelieve that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax\\noutcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when\\nfacts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is\\ndifferent from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have\\na material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\\n90\\nTable of Contents\\nAdvertising Expense\\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on the consolidated statements of income. We incurred\\nadvertising expenses of $2.26 billion, $1.57 billion, and $1.10 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash\\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase.\\nWe hold investments in marketable securities, consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate\\ndebt securities. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale (AFS) investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash\\navailable for current operations. Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, included in accumulated\\nother comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders\\' equity. AFS debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to\\ndetermine what amount of that difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a charge\\nin  interest  and  other  income  (expense),  net  on  our  consolidated  statements  of  income,  and  any  remaining  unrealized  losses,  net  of  taxes,  are  included  in\\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders\\' equity. The amount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 was not\\nmaterial. There was no impairment charge for any unrealized losses in 2019 and 2018. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a\\nspecific identification method and record such gains or losses as interest and other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income.\\nWe also maintain a multi-currency notional cash pool for our participating entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physically\\nconverted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. We classify the overdraft balances within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on\\nthe consolidated balance sheets.\\nWe classify certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets based upon\\nthe term of the remaining restrictions.\\nEquity Investments\\nOur equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily determinable market values. We elected to account\\nfor  most  of  our  equity  investments  using  the  measurement  alternative,  which  is  cost,  less  any  impairment,  adjusted  for  changes  in  fair  value  resulting  from\\nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The change in carrying value, if any, is recognized in interest and other income\\n(expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. We periodically review our equity investments for impairment. If indicators exist and the estimated fair\\nvalue of an investment is below the carrying amount, we will write down the investment to fair value. In addition, we also held equity investments accounted for\\nunder the equity method which were immaterial as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Equity investments had a carrying value of $6.23 billion and $86 million as of\\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There was no material impairment in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\\nWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in\\nthe financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\\norderly transaction  between market  participants  at the measurement  date. When determining  the fair value measurements  for assets and liabilities,  which are\\nrequired to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements\\nor assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk.\\nFair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization\\nwithin the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\\nLevel 1- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\n91\\nTable of Contents\\nLevel 2- Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\\nliabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or\\nliabilities.\\nLevel 3- Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\\'s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the\\nasset or liability.\\nOur valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of cash equivalents and marketable debt securities were derived from quoted market prices or\\nalternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs.\\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. We make estimates\\nof expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit losses and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors,\\nincluding  historical  experience,  the  age  of  the  accounts  receivable  balances,  credit  quality  of  our  customers,  current  economic  conditions,  reasonable  and\\nsupportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. Expected credit losses are recorded as\\ngeneral  and  administrative  expenses  on  our  consolidated  statements  of  income.  As  of  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  our  accounts  receivable,  net  were\\n$11.33 billion and $9.52 billion, respectively, and the allowances of accounts receivable were immaterial.\\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under finance leases, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed\\nusing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\\nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment are described below:\\nProperty and Equipment \\nUseful Life \\nNetwork equipment\\nThree to 20 years\\nBuildings\\nThree to 30 years\\nComputer software, office equipment and other\\nTwo to five years\\nFinance lease right-of-use assets\\nThree to 20 years\\nLeasehold improvements\\nLesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\\n \\nThe useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the\\nremaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate of useful lives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but\\nmay differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and\\ntechnological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for\\nprospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life. Historically changes in useful lives have not resulted in material changes to our\\ndepreciation and amortization expense.\\nLand and assets held within construction in progress are not depreciated. Construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property\\nand equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use.\\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation\\nare removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.\\n92\\nTable of Contents\\nLease Obligations\\nWe have operating leases comprised of certain offices, data center, land, colocations, and equipment leases. We also have finance leases for certain network\\nequipment. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include\\nfixed payments for maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and account for them as a\\nsingle lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate\\ntaxes or other costs. Such variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and equipment leases, we\\napply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities.\\nFor leases that have greater than 12-month lease term, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at commencement\\ndate based on the present value of remaining fixed lease payments. We consider only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.\\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determining the\\nprobability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based, asset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors.\\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in\\ndetermining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would\\nbe in a similar economic environment.\\nOperating  leases  are  included  in  operating  lease  ROU  assets,  operating  lease  liabilities,  current  and  operating  lease  liabilities,  non-current  on  our\\nconsolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our\\nconsolidated balance sheets.\\nResults and disclosure requirements for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 are presented under Topic 842, while prior period amounts have\\nnot been adjusted and continue to be reported under Topic 840.\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.\\nCertain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various\\nlegal and regulatory obligations around the world. The requirements  for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation  and\\nenforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With\\nrespect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable\\nthat a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or\\nrange of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that has been previously recorded, and the matters and\\nrelated  possible  losses  disclosed.  We  make  adjustments  to  our  provisions  and  changes  to  our  disclosures  accordingly  to  reflect  the  impact  of  negotiations,\\nsettlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated\\namount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe  allocate  the  fair  value  of  purchase  consideration  to  the  tangible  assets  acquired,  liabilities  assumed  and  intangible  assets  acquired  based  on  their\\nestimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\\nSuch valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing\\ncertain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users,\\n93\\nTable of Contents\\nacquired technology, acquired patents, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management\\'s estimates of fair value\\nare  based  upon  assumptions  believed  to  be  reasonable,  but  which  are  inherently  uncertain  and  unpredictable  and,  as  a  result,  actual  results  may  differ  from\\nestimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects Company amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets\\nare amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is\\nnot to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill.\\nUpon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\\nLong-lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles Assets\\nWe  evaluate  the  recoverability  of  property  and  equipment  and  acquired  finite-lived  intangible  assets  for  possible  impairment  whenever  events  or\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash\\nflows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts\\nto the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of\\nproperty and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant\\nimpairment charges during the years presented.\\nWe review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair\\nvalue of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of December 31, 2020, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We routinely review the remaining\\nestimated useful lives of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining\\nunamortized balance is amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life.\\nForeign Currency\\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S.\\ndollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are\\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders\\' equity. As of December 31, 2020 we had a cumulative translation\\ngain, net of tax of $439 million and as of December 31, 2019, we had a cumulative translation loss, net of tax of $617 million. Net losses resulting from foreign\\nexchange transactions were $129 million, $105 million, and $213 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. These losses were\\nrecorded as interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income.\\nCredit Risk and Concentration\\nOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable\\nsecurities,  and  accounts  receivable.  The  majority  of  cash  equivalents  consists  of  money  market  funds,  that  primarily  invest  in  U.S.  government  and  agency\\nsecurities. Marketable securities consist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt\\nsecurities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and diversified among individual issuers. The amount of credit losses recorded for\\nthe year ended December 31, 2020 was not material.\\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different industries and countries. We generated\\n42%  of  our  revenue  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020  and  43%  of  our  revenue  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2019  and  2018  from  marketers  and\\ndevelopers based in the United States, with the majority of revenue outside of the United States coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Canada,\\nAustralia, Japan, Vietnam and Brazil.\\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses and\\nbad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended\\n94\\nTable of Contents\\nDecember  31,  2020,  2019,  or  2018.  In  the  event  that  accounts  receivable  collection  cycles  deteriorate,  our  operating  results  and  financial  position  could  be\\nadversely affected.\\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\\nSegments\\nOur chief operating decision-maker is our Chief Executive Officer who makes resource allocation decisions and assesses performance based on financial\\ninformation presented on a consolidated basis. There are no segment managers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision-maker, or anyone else, for\\noperations, operating results, and planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, we have determined that we have a single\\nreportable segment and operating segment structure.\\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\nFair Value Measurements\\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-13, Changes to Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements (Topic\\n820), which improved the effectiveness of disclosure requirements for recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The standard removes, modifies, and\\nadds certain disclosure requirements. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\nCredit Losses\\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\\nLosses  on  Financial  Instruments,  using  the  modified  retrospective  transition  method.  Upon  adoption,  we  changed  our  impairment  model  to  utilize  a  current\\nexpected credit losses (CECL) model in place of the incurred loss methodology for financial instruments measured at amortized cost, including our accounts\\nreceivable. In addition, we modified our impairment model for AFS debt securities and to discontinue using the concept of \"other than temporary\" impairment on\\nAFS  debt  securities.  CECL  estimates  on  accounts  receivable  are  recorded  as  general  and  administrative  expenses  on  our  consolidated  statements  of  income.\\nAllowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a charge in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income.\\nThe cumulative effect adjustment from adoption was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. We continue to monitor the financial implications of the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic on expected credit losses.\\nIncome Taxes\\nOn October 1, 2020, we early adopted Accounting Standard Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\\n(ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. This guidance was effective beginning January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. The\\nadoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\nIn January 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-01, Investments—Equity Securities\\n(Topic  321),  Investments—Equity  Method  and  Joint  Ventures  (Topic  323),  and  Derivatives  and  Hedging  (Topic  815) (ASU  2020-01),  which  clarifies  the\\ninteraction of the accounting for equity securities under Topic 321, the accounting for equity method investments in Topic 323, and the accounting for certain\\nforward contracts and purchased options in Topic 815. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2021 and do not expect the adoption of this guidance to\\nhave a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and\\nDerivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity\\'s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity\\n(ASU  2020-06),  which  simplifies  the  accounting  for  convertible  instruments  by  reducing  the  number  of  accounting  models  available  for  convertible  debt\\ninstruments. This guidance also eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires the use of the\\nif-converted method.

Earnings per Share\\nWe compute earnings per share (EPS) of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method required for participating securities. We consider\\nrestricted  stock  awards  to  be  participating  securities  because  holders  of  such  shares  have  non-forfeitable  dividend  rights  in  the  event  of  our  declaration  of  a\\ndividend for common shares.\\nUndistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in determining net income attributable to common stockholders.\\nBasic EPS is computed  by dividing net income  attributable  to common  stockholders  by the  weighted-average  number of shares of our Class A and Class B\\ncommon stock outstanding, adjusted for outstanding shares that are subject to repurchase.\\nFor the calculation of diluted EPS, net income attributable to common stockholders for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including\\nawards under our equity compensation plans. In 2018, the calculation of diluted EPS also included the effect  of inducement  awards under separate  non-plan\\nrestricted stock unit (RSU) award agreements.\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(2)\\n96\\nTable of Contents\\nIn addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock,\\nwhile the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS attributable to common\\nstockholders is computed by dividing the resulting net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common\\nshares outstanding.\\nRSUs with anti-dilutive effect were excluded from the EPS calculation and they were not material for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\\nBasic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights.\\nThe numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as follows (in millions, except per share\\namounts):\\n \\nYear Ended December 31,\\n \\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\n \\nClass \\nA\\nClass \\nB\\nClass \\nA\\nClass \\nB\\nClass \\nA\\nClass\\nB \\nBasic EPS:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNumerator\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNet income\\n$\\n24,607 \\n$\\n4,539 \\n$\\n15,569 \\n$\\n2,916 \\n$\\n18,411 \\n$\\n3,701 \\nLess: Net income attributable to participating securities\\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n(1)\\n— \\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\\n$\\n24,607 \\n$\\n4,539 \\n$\\n15,569 \\n$\\n2,916 \\n$\\n18,410 \\n$\\n3,701 \\nDenominator\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWeighted-average shares outstanding\\n2,407 \\n444 \\n2,404 \\n450 \\n2,406 \\n484 \\nBasic EPS\\n$\\n10.22 \\n$\\n10.22 \\n$\\n6.48 \\n$\\n6.48 \\n$\\n7.65 \\n$\\n7.65 \\nDiluted EPS:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNumerator\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\\n$\\n24,607 \\n$\\n4,539 \\n$\\n15,569 \\n$\\n2,916 \\n$\\n18,410 \\n$\\n3,701 \\nReallocation of net income attributable to participating securities\\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n1 \\n— \\nReallocation of net income as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A\\ncommon stock\\n4,539 \\n— \\n2,916 \\n— \\n3,701 \\n— \\nReallocation of net income to Class B common stock\\n— \\n(58)\\n— \\n(18)\\n— \\n(16)\\nNet income for diluted EPS\\n$\\n29,146 \\n$\\n4,481 \\n$\\n18,485 \\n$\\n2,898 \\n$\\n22,112 \\n$\\n3,685 \\nDenominator\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNumber of shares used for basic EPS computation\\n2,407 \\n444 \\n2,404 \\n450 \\n2,406 \\n484 \\nConversion of Class B to Class A common stock\\n444 \\n— \\n450 \\n— \\n484 \\n— \\nWeighted-average effect of dilutive RSUs and employee stock options\\n37 \\n— \\n22 \\n1 \\n31 \\n3 \\nNumber of shares used for diluted EPS computation\\n2,888 \\n444 \\n2,876 \\n451 \\n2,921 \\n487 \\nDiluted EPS\\n$\\n10.09 \\n$\\n10.09 \\n$\\n6.43 \\n$\\n6.43 \\n$\\n7.57 \\n$\\n7.57 \\n97\\nTable of Contents\\nNote 4.

The aggregate absolute value of these Level 3 assets and liabilities was not material to our consolidated financial\\nstatements as of December 31, 2020.\\nOn July 7, 2020, we completed our equity investment in Jio and noted observable transactions in similar securities subsequent to the date of our investment.\\nBased on our assessment,  we concluded  no change in  fair value  from the  initial  carrying  value  of $5.82 billion  was required  as a result  of these  observable\\ntransactions. Had there been a change in the fair value, our investment in Jio would be classified within Level 3.

Construction in progress includes costs mostly related to construction of data\\ncenters, network equipment infrastructure to support our data centers around the world, and office buildings.\\nNote 8. Leases\\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, data centers, land, colocations, and equipment. We have\\nalso entered into various non-cancelable finance lease agreements for certain network equipment. Our leases have original lease periods expiring between 2021 and\\n2093. Many leases include one or more options to renew. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be\\nreasonably assured.

Long-term Debt\\nIn May 2016, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and any amounts outstanding under this facility would be due and\\npayable on May 20, 2021. No amount had been drawn down under this credit facility, and it was terminated on December 24, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we\\nhad no outstanding long-term debt.\\nNote 12. Commitments and Contingencies\\nGuarantee\\nIn  2018,  we  established  a  multi-currency  notional  cash  pool  for  certain  of  our  entities  with  a  third-party  bank  provider.  Actual  cash  balances  are  not\\nphysically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to\\nour participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In the\\nunlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc.\\nOther Contractual Commitments\\nWe also have $7.50 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2020, which are mostly related to our investments in network\\ninfrastructure, consumer hardware, content costs and data center operations. The majority of these commitments are due within five years.\\nLegal and Related Matters\\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere\\nagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with\\nour platform and user data practices as well as\\n(1)\\n103\\nTable of Contents\\nthe misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and\\ninjunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and\\nofficers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified\\ndamages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative\\nsecurities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the\\nconsolidated putative securities class action, with leave to amend. On November 15, 2019, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative\\nsecurities class action. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with leave to amend. On October 16,\\n2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously\\ndefending them. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of\\nU.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. In July 2019,\\nwe entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among\\nother matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consent\\norder.\\nOn April 1, 2015, a putative class action was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by Facebook users alleging\\nthat the \"tag suggestions\" facial recognition feature violates the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. On\\nApril 16, 2018, the district court certified a class of Illinois residents, and on May 14, 2018, the district court denied both parties\\' motions for summary judgment.\\nOn May 29, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for review of the class certification order and stayed the proceeding. On\\nAugust 8, 2019, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the class certification order. On December 2, 2019, we filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of\\nthe decision of the Ninth Circuit, which was denied. On January 15, 2020, the parties agreed to a settlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit, which provided for a\\npayment of $550 million by us and was subject to court approval. On or about May 8, 2020, the parties executed a formal settlement agreement, and plaintiffs filed\\na motion for preliminary approval of the settlement by the district court. On June 4, 2020, the district court denied the plaintiffs\\' motion without prejudice. On July\\n22, 2020, the parties executed an amended settlement agreement, which, among other terms, provides for a payment of $650 million by us. On August 19, 2020,\\nthe court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to final court approval. The settlement amount is reflected in accrued expenses\\nand other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.\\nBeginning on September  28, 2018, multiple  putative  class actions were filed  in  state  and federal  courts in  the United States and elsewhere  against  us\\nalleging violations of consumer protection laws and other causes of action in connection with a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook\\'s\\ncode to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. The\\nactions filed in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On November 26, 2019, the district court\\ncertified a class for injunctive relief purposes but denied certification of a class for purposes of pursuing damages. On January 16, 2020, the parties agreed to a\\nsettlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit. On November 15, 2020, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to final\\ncourt approval. We believe the remaining lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In addition, the events surrounding this cyber-attack\\nbecame the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) and other government inquiries.\\nFrom time to time we also notify the IDPC, our designated European privacy regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation, of certain other\\npersonal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. Although we are\\nvigorously  defending  our  regulatory  compliance,  we  believe  there  is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  the  ultimate  potential  loss  related  to  the  inquiries  and\\ninvestigations by the IDPC could be material in the aggregate.\\nIn addition, from time to time, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in\\nparticular  in Brazil  and  Europe, in  order to  ascertain  the precise  scope of our legal  obligations  to comply  with the  requests of those agencies,  including  our\\nobligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties against us.\\nWe believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines\\nand penalties.\\n104\\nTable of Contents\\nWith respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described above, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we\\nbelieve a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of\\nthese matters. With respect to the matters described above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible loss, such losses or range of\\npossible  losses  either  cannot  be  estimated  or  are  not  individually  material,  but  we  believe  there  is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  they  may  be  material  in  the\\naggregate.\\nWe are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course\\nof business. For example, from time to time we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition\\nauthorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in\\nthe areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as past acquisitions. For example, in June\\n2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the\\nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of\\nthe Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on\\naccess to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and\\nstate attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against us\\nin the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive  conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act by\\nacquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleges that we violated Section 7\\nof the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The lawsuits of the FTC and attorneys general both seek a permanent injunction against our company\\'s\\nalleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. Multiple putative class\\nactions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection\\nwith these acquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. We believe these lawsuits are without\\nmerit, and we are vigorously defending them.\\nAdditionally,  we  are  required  to  comply  with  various  legal  and  regulatory  obligations  around  the  world.  The  requirements  for  complying  with  these\\nobligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations\\ncould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these other legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government inquiries and\\ninvestigations, and other matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss\\nis probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these other\\nmatters. We believe that the amount of losses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these other matters will not, either individually or in the\\naggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.\\nThe ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or\\nprobable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against\\nus for amounts in excess of management\\'s estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which\\nany such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.\\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 15—Income Taxes.\\n105\\nTable of Contents\\nIndemnifications\\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain\\nmatters.  We have  agreed  to hold certain  parties  harmless  against  losses arising  from a breach  of representations  or covenants,  or out  of intellectual  property\\ninfringement or other claims made by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the\\nclaim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation and\\nbylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.\\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification\\nclaims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a\\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2020, there was not at least a reasonable possibility we had incurred a\\nmaterial loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. We have not recorded any liability for costs related to indemnification through December 31, 2020.\\nNote 13. Stockholders\\' Equity\\nCommon Stock\\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2020, we are authorized\\nto issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share. Holders\\nof our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the\\nholders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31, 2020, we have not declared any dividends. The holder of each\\nshare of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class B\\ncommon stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock\\nupon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless\\notherwise noted.\\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  there  were  2,406  million  shares  of  Class  A  common  stock  and  443  million  shares  of  Class  B  common  stock  issued  and\\noutstanding.\\nShare Repurchase Program\\nOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an\\nexpiration date. As of December 31, 2019, $4.90 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases under this program. In January 2020, an additional\\n$10.00 billion of repurchases was authorized under this program. In 2020, we repurchased and subsequently retired 27 million shares of our Class A common stock\\nfor  $6.30  billion.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  $8.60  billion  remained  available  and  authorized  for  repurchases.  In  January  2021,  an  additional  $25  billion  of\\nrepurchases was authorized under this program.\\nThe timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and\\nmarket  conditions,  and  other  investment  opportunities,  and  shares  may  be  repurchased  through  open  market  purchases  or  privately  negotiated  transactions,\\nincluding through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\\nShare-based Compensation Plans\\nIn 2020, we maintained one active share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, which was amended in each of June 2016 and\\nFebruary 2018 (Amended 2012 Plan). Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive and nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, stock\\nappreciation rights, RSUs, performance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors and consultants. Shares that are withheld in connection with the\\nnet settlement of RSUs or forfeited under our stock plan are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan. We account for forfeitures as they occur.\\n106\\nTable of Contents\\nShare-based compensation expense mostly consists of the Company\\'s restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured based\\non the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on the\\nstraight-line basis over the requisite service period.\\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were 129 million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan. Pursuant\\nto the automatic increase provision under our Amended 2012 Plan, the number of shares reserved for issuance increases automatically on January 1 of each of the\\ncalendar years during the term of the Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through April 2026 , by a number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the\\nlesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the immediately preceding December 31st or (ii) a number of shares\\ndetermined by our board of directors. Pursuant to this automatic increase provision, our board of directors approved an increase of 16 million shares reserved for\\nissuance effective January 1, 2021.\\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2020:\\nNumber of Shares\\nWeighted-Average\\nGrant Date Fair Value\\n(in thousands)\\nUnvested at December 31, 2019\\n78,851 \\n$\\n165.74 \\nGranted\\n62,032 \\n$\\n188.73 \\nVested\\n(38,857)\\n$\\n162.27 \\nForfeited\\n(5,293)\\n$\\n165.72 \\nUnvested at December 31, 2020\\n96,733 \\n$\\n181.88 \\nThe  fair  value  as  of  the  respective  vesting  dates  of  RSUs  that  vested  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2020,  2019,  and  2018  was  $9.38  billion,\\n$6.01 billion, and $7.57 billion, respectively.\\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  there  was  $16.50  billion  of  unrecognized  share-based  compensation  expense  related  to  RSUs  awards.  This  unrecognized\\ncompensation  expense  is  expected  to  be  recognized  over  a  weighted-average  period  of  approximately  three  years  based  on  vesting  under  the  award  service\\nconditions.\\nNote 14.

We have federal tax credit carryforwards of $424 million, which will begin to expire in 2029, if not utilized, and state\\ntax credit carryforwards of $2.65 billion, most of which do not expire.\\nUtilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations\\nprovided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit\\ncarryforwards before their utilization. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater\\nthan 50% over a three‑year period.\\nThe following table reflects changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\\n \\nYear Ended December 31, \\n \\n2020\\n2019\\n2018\\nGross unrecognized tax benefits ‑ beginning of period\\n$\\n7,863 \\n$\\n4,678 \\n$\\n3,870 \\nIncreases related to prior year tax positions\\n356 \\n2,309 \\n457 \\nDecreases related to prior year tax positions\\n(253)\\n(525)\\n(396)\\nIncreases related to current year tax positions\\n1,045 \\n1,402 \\n831 \\nDecreases related to settlements of prior year tax positions\\n(319)\\n(1)\\n(84)\\nGross unrecognized tax benefits ‑ end of period\\n$\\n8,692 \\n$\\n7,863 \\n$\\n4,678 \\n109\\nTable of Contents\\nDuring  all  years  presented,  we  recognized  interest  and  penalties  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits  within  the  provision  for  income  taxes  on  the\\nconsolidated  statements  of  income.  The  amount  of  interest  and  penalties  accrued  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2019  were  $774  million  and  $747  million,\\nrespectively.\\nIf the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits of $8.69 billion as of December 31, 2020 were realized in a future period, this would result in a tax benefit\\nof $4.85 billion within our provision of income taxes at such time.\\nOn July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court issued a decision (Tax Court Decision) in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, which concluded that related parties\\nin a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to share-based compensation. The Tax Court Decision was appealed by the Commissioner\\nto the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit). On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion (Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion) that reversed the Tax\\nCourt Decision. Based on the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion, we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of $1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2019. On July\\n22, 2019, the taxpayer requested a rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit and the request was denied on November 12, 2019. The taxpayer requested a hearing\\nbefore the Supreme Court of the United States and the request was denied on June 22, 2020. Since we started to accrue income tax for share-based compensation\\ncost-sharing expense in the second quarter of 2019, the denial of the request by the Supreme Court did not have a material impact to our financial results in 2020.\\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to\\npotential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2014 through 2016 and 2018\\ntax years and by the Irish tax authorities for our 2016 through 2018 tax years. Our 2017 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by the IRS. Our 2019\\nand subsequent tax years remain open to examination in Ireland.\\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with\\nthe examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent\\nto 2010. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS filed its\\nPretrial Memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session of\\nthe trial began in February 2020 and a second session is expected to continue in 2021. It is not clear how the IRS intends to apply the revised adjustment to future\\nyears. Based on the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an\\nestimated,  aggregate  amount  of  up  to  approximately  $9.0  billion  in  excess  of  the  amounts  in  our  originally  filed  U.S.  return,  plus  interest  and  any  penalties\\nasserted.\\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its\\nposition from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain\\ntax  credits  that  we  claimed.  If  the  IRS  prevails  in  its  position  for  these  new  adjustments,  this  could  result  in  an  additional  federal  tax  liability  of  up  to\\napproximately  $680 million  in  excess  of the  amounts  in  our  originally  filed  U.S. returns,  plus  interest  and  any  penalties  asserted.  We  do  not  agree  with  the\\npositions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.\\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes, that is lower than the potential\\nadditional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions\\nrelated to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under\\nthe mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). As of December 31, 2020, we have not resolved\\nthese matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.\\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax items\\nthat may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably\\npossible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining that are subject\\nto examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized\\n110\\nTable of Contents\\ntax benefits. If the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse\\nimpact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\\nNote 16.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\\nNone.\\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO), has evaluated the effectiveness of our\\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)), as of\\nthe end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31, 2020,\\nour disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are\\nrequired to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in\\nthe rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including\\nour CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nManagement\\'s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the\\nExchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal\\nControl—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the assessment,\\nmanagement has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting firm,\\nErnst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report\\non Form 10-K.\\nChanges in Internal Control\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management\\'s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the\\nExchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2020 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls\\nand procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the\\ndesign  of  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  and  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  must  reflect  the  fact  that  there  are  resource  constraints  and  that\\nmanagement is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\\nItem 9B.

For purposes of this Agreement, the “Company” shall be deemed to include Facebook and its subsidiaries, as\\nappropriate.\\nWHEREAS, the Company has determined that it is in the best interest of the Company to enter into certain business activities in ____ through ____ (the\\n“Subsidiary”);\\nWHEREAS,  in  connection  with  the  application  of  the  Subsidiary  to  conduct  such  business  activities  under  the  laws,  regulations  and  rules  of  ____\\n(collectively, “Applicable Law”), Indemnitee may be subject to potential liability should the Subsidiary fail to comply with Applicable Law due to Indemnitee’s\\ncontrol over the Company; and\\nWHEREAS, the operations of the Subsidiary benefit the Company and, therefore, the Company has agreed to indemnify Indemnitee as set forth herein.\\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby\\nacknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the Company and Indemnitee hereby agree as set forth below.\\n1.\\nIndemnification of Expenses and Other Liabilities.\\n(a)    The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law if Indemnitee was or is or becomes a party to or other\\nparticipant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or other participant in, any Claim (as defined herein) under Applicable Law arising from or related to\\nany failure or alleged failure by the Subsidiary to comply with any requirement (including, without limitation, any capitalization requirement) under\\nApplicable Law, or on any other basis under Applicable Law that would assign, or purport to assign, liability to Indemnitee by reason of his control over\\nthe  Company,  for  any  Expenses  (as  defined  herein)  or  any  Other  Liabilities  (as  defined  herein),  including,  without  limitation,  all  interest,  penalties,\\nassessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such Expenses or Other Liabilities, unless and only to the extent such\\nExpenses or Other Liabilities are finally judicially determined (after exhaustion of all appeals) to have arisen out of Indemnitee’s bad faith or willful\\nmisconduct (with the burden of proof on the Company) (any such Claim, a “Covered Claim”). Such payment of Expenses or Other Liabilities shall be\\nmade by the Company as soon as practicable but in any event no later than five (5) business days after written demand by Indemnitee therefor is presented\\nto the Company (including, for clarity, prior to the final disposition of any Covered Claim).\\n(b)    Indemnitee shall, as a condition precedent to Indemnitee’s right to be indemnified under this Agreement, give the Company notice in\\nwriting as soon as practicable of any Covered Claim made against Indemnitee for which indemnification will or could be sought under this Agreement;\\nprovided, however, that the failure to so provide notice to the Company shall not relieve the Company from any liability that it may have to Indemnitee\\nhereunder unless and only to the extent the Company’s ability to participate in the defense of such Covered Claim was materially and adversely affected\\nby such failure. In addition, at the Company’s sole cost and expense, Indemnitee shall give the Company such information and cooperation with respect to\\na Covered Claim as the Company may reasonably require and as shall be within Indemnitee’s power, to the extent that doing so is consistent with the\\nexercise of Indemnitee’s rights under applicable federal, state, local or foreign law. The Company shall, at the Company’s sole cost and expense, provide\\nIndemnitee with such information and cooperation with respect to a Covered Claim as Indemnitee\\n1\\nmay reasonably require, to the extent that doing so is consistent with the Company’s obligation to cooperate with regulatory or law enforcement agencies.\\n(c)     In  connection  with  any  Covered  Claim,  the  Company  shall  indemnify  Indemnitee  to  the  fullest  extent  permitted  by  law  against  any\\nExpenses or Other Liabilities incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the interpretation, enforcement or defense of Indemnitee’s rights (i) under this\\nAgreement, (ii) under any other document, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, insurance policy or other written instrument, or (iii)\\nunder  any  applicable  federal,  state,  local  or  foreign  law.  Such  payment  of  Expenses  or Other  Liabilities  shall  be  made  by the  Company  as soon  as\\npracticable but in any event no later than five (5) business days after written demand by Indemnitee therefor is presented to the Company (including, for\\nclarity, prior to the final disposition of any Covered Claim).\\n(d)     The  indemnification  provided  by  this  Agreement  shall  be  in  addition  to  any  rights  to  which  Indemnitee  may  be  entitled  under  the\\nCompany’s Certificate of Incorporation, its Bylaws (as now hereafter in effect), any other agreement (including, without limitation, the Indemnification\\nAgreement between the Company and Indemnitee dated as of ____), any vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, the General Corporation Law of\\nthe State of Delaware, or otherwise. The indemnification provided under this Agreement shall continue in perpetuity as to Indemnitee for any action taken\\nor not taken while serving in an indemnified capacity, regardless of whether Indemnitee continues to serve in such capacity.\\n(e)    In the event the Company shall be obligated hereunder to pay the Expenses or Other Liabilities of any Covered Claim, the Company shall\\nbe entitled to assume the defense of such Covered Claim with counsel approved by Indemnitee (not to be unreasonably withheld) upon the delivery to\\nIndemnitee  of written  notice  of the Company’s election  so to do. If the Company  elects  to do so, the Company  agrees to indemnify  and reimburse\\nIndemnitee  for  any  Expenses  or  Other  Liabilities  incurred  by  Indemnitee  in  connection  with  such  Covered  Claim  prior  to  and  after  such  election;\\nprovided, that,  the  Company  shall  not  be  entitled  to  settle  any  such  Covered  Claim  without  the  prior  written  consent  of  Indemnitee  (not  to  be\\nunreasonably withheld), unless such settlement solely involves the payment of money and provides for a full and final release of all Claims asserted\\nagainst Indemnitee.\\n(f)    The Company hereby agrees to indemnify Indemnitee with respect to any Claims referenced in clauses (a), (c) and (e) of this Section 1 to\\nthe fullest extent permitted by law, notwithstanding that such indemnification is not specifically authorized by the other provisions of this Agreement, the\\nCompany’s Certificate of Incorporation, the Company’s Bylaws (as now or hereafter in effect) or by statute.\\n(g)    For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any Claim by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or\\nconviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of\\nconduct  or  have  any  particular  belief  or  that  a  court  has  determined  that  indemnification  is  not  permitted  by  applicable  law.  For  purposes  of  this\\nAgreement,  without  creating  any  presumption  as  to  the  existence  of  bad  faith  or  willful  misconduct  if  the  following  circumstances  do  not  exist,\\nIndemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and without willful misconduct if Indemnitee’s actions or omissions to act are taken in good faith\\nreliance upon the records of the Company, including, without limitation, its financial statements, or upon information, opinions, reports, statements or\\nrecommendations furnished or made to Indemnitee by the officers or employees of the Company or its subsidiaries (including, without limitation, the\\nSubsidiary) in the course of their duties, or by committees of the Board, or by any other person (including, without limitation, legal counsel, accountants\\nand financial advisors), as to matters Indemnitee reasonably believes are within such other person’s professional or expert competence and who has been\\nselected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Company.\\n(h)    For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall be defined as follows:\\n2\\ni.    “Claim” shall mean any actual, threatened, pending or completed action, suit, proceeding, claim, counterclaim, cross claim, arbitration,\\nmediation, regulatory process, alternative dispute resolution mechanism, hearing, inquiry or investigation, whether brought in the right\\nof  the  Company  or  otherwise  and  whether  of  a  civil,  criminal,  administrative,  legislative,  regulatory,  enforcement  or  investigative\\n(formal  or  informal)  nature,  including,  without  limitation,  any  appeal  therefrom.  If  Indemnitee  believes  in  good  faith  that  a  given\\nsituation may lead to, or result in, the institution of a Claim, then such situation shall be considered a Claim.\\nii.    “Expenses” shall mean any and all expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses and all other fees,\\ncosts, expenses and retainers, including, without limitation, court costs, transcript costs, the fees and other costs of experts and other\\nprofessionals, witness fees, travel expenses, duplicating costs, printing and binding costs, telephone charges, postage, delivery service\\nfees and all other charges, disbursements and obligations) incurred in connection with, or as a result of, investigating, defending, being\\na witness in or participating in (including, without limitation, on appeal), or preparing to defend, to be a witness in or to participate in,\\nany Claim. Expenses also shall include expenses incurred in connection with any appeal resulting from any Claim, including, without\\nlimitation, the premium, security for, and other costs relating to any cost bond, supersedeas bond, or other appeal bond or its equivalent.\\niii.    “Other Liabilities” shall mean damages (including, without limitation, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, indirect and punitive\\ndamages),  losses,  liabilities,  awards,  judgments,  fines,  penalties,  assessments,  deficiencies  and  amounts  paid  in  settlement  (if  such\\nsettlement is approved in advance by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) arising from or related to any\\nClaim, and any federal, state, local or foreign taxes imposed on Indemnitee as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of any payments\\nunder this Agreement.\\n2.     Contribution and Reimbursement.\\n(a)    Whether or not the indemnification provided in Section 1 hereof is available, in respect of any actual, threatened, pending or completed\\nCovered Claim in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), the Company shall pay\\nthe entire amount of any Expenses and Other Liabilities of such Covered Claim without requiring Indemnitee to contribute to such payment and the\\nCompany hereby waives and relinquishes any right of contribution it may have against Indemnitee.\\n(b)    The Company shall not enter into any settlement of any Covered Claim in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would\\nbe if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), without the prior written consent of Indemnitee (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), unless such\\nsettlement solely involves the payment of money and provides for a full and final release of all Claims asserted against Indemnitee.\\n(c)    Without diminishing or impairing the obligations of the Company set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 2, if, for any reason,\\nIndemnitee shall elect or be required to pay all or any portion of any Expenses or Other Liabilities in any actual, threatened, pending or completed\\nCovered Claim, the Company shall reimburse Indemnitee for the entire amount of Expenses or Other Liabilities actually incurred and paid or payable by\\nIndemnitee.\\n3.    Advancement of Expenses. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall advance all Expenses and\\nOther Liabilities incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any Covered Claim within five (5) business days after the receipt\\n3\\nby the Company of a statement or statements from Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after\\nfinal disposition of such Covered Claim. Such statement or statements shall include or be preceded or accompanied by a written undertaking by\\nor on behalf of Indemnitee to repay any Expenses or Other Liabilities advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled\\nto  be  indemnified  against  such  Expenses  or  Other  Liabilities.  Any  advances  and  undertakings  to  repay  pursuant  to  this  Section  3  shall  be\\nunsecured and interest free.\\n4.     Miscellaneous.\\n(a)    The knowledge or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company or the Company itself\\nshall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.\\n(b)    This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original.\\n(c)    This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors,\\nassigns (including, without limitation, any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the\\nbusiness or assets of the Company), spouses, heirs and personal and legal representatives. The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether\\ndirect or indirect, and whether by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all, substantially all, or a substantial part, of the business or assets of\\nthe Company, by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the\\nsame manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.\\n(d)    This Agreement shall continue in effect until such time as Indemnitee is no longer the ultimate controlling shareholder of the Subsidiary as\\ndefined under Applicable Law and no longer subject to any potential liability for any Covered Claim (including, without limitation, the pendency of any\\nproceeding or appeal), regardless of whether Indemnitee continues to serve in an indemnified capacity.\\n(e)    This Agreement shall be governed by, and its provisions construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware as\\napplied to contracts between Delaware residents entered into and to be performed entirely within the State of Delaware.\\n(f)    No amendment, modification, termination or cancellation of this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing signed by both the\\nparties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to be or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof\\n(whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.\\n(g)    This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and\\nmerges all previous written and oral negotiations, commitments, understandings and agreements relating to the subject matter hereof between the parties\\nhereto.\\n[Signature Page Next]\\n4\\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Indemnification Agreement as of the date first above written.\\nFACEBOOK, INC.\\nBy: ___________________________\\nName: ___________________________\\nTitle: ___________________________\\nAGREED TO AND ACCEPTED\\nINDEMNITEE:\\n___________________________\\nSignature\\n___________________________\\n(address)\\n5\\nEXHIBIT 21.1\\nLIST OF SUBSIDIARIES\\nFACEBOOK, INC. \\nAndale, LLC (Delaware)\\nCassin Networks ApS (Denmark)\\nFacebook Holdings, LLC (Delaware)\\nFacebook Ireland Holdings Unlimited (Ireland)\\nFacebook Ireland Limited (Ireland)\\nFacebook Operations, LLC (Delaware)\\nFacebook Payments Inc.

forwardlooking statements all statements contained in this annual report on form k other than statements of historical fact including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position our business strategy and plans and our objectives for future operations are forwardlooking statements the words believe may will estimate continue anticipate intend expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements we have based these forwardlooking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition results of operations business strategy shortterm and longterm business operations and objectives and financial needs these forwardlooking statements are subject to a number of risks uncertainties and assumptions including those described in part i item a risk factors in this annual report on form k moreover we operate in a very competitive and

uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forwardlooking statements unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise the terms facebook company we us and our in this document refer to facebook inc a delaware corporation and where appropriate its subsidiaries the term facebook may also refer to our products regardless of the manner in which they are accessed the term family refers to our facebook instagram messenger and whatsapp products for references to accessing facebook or our other products on the web or via a website such terms refer to accessing such products on personal computers for references to accessing facebook or our other products on mobile such term refers to accessing such products via a mobile application or via a mobileoptimized version of our websites such as mfacebookcom whether on a mobile phone or tablet table of contents limitations of key metrics and other data the numbers for our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts we have historically reported the numbers of our daily active users daus monthly active users maus and average revenue per user arpu collectively our facebook metrics based on user activity only on facebook and messenger and not on our other products beginning with our annual report on form k for the year ended december  we also report our estimates of the numbers of our daily active people dap monthly active people map and average revenue per person arpp collectively our family metrics based on the activity of users who visited at least one of facebook instagram messenger and whatsapp collectively our family of products during the applicable period of measurement we believe our family metrics better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one of our products as a result over time we intend to report our family metrics as key metrics in place of daus maus and arpu in our periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world the methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors in addition we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments we generally do not intend to update previously disclosed family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below in addition our facebook metrics and family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology facebook metrics we regularly evaluate our facebook metrics to estimate the number of duplicate and false accounts among our maus a duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account we divide false accounts into two categories usermisclassified accounts where users have created personal profiles for a business organization or nonhuman entity such as a pet such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service and violating accounts which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service such as bots and spam the estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical ip addresses and similar user names and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers any loss of access to data signals we use in this process whether as a result of our own product decisions actions by thirdparty browser or mobile platforms regulatory or legislative requirements limitations while our personnel work remotely during the covid pandemic or other factors also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve including through the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates in the fourth quarter of we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the philippines and vietnam as compared to more developed markets in the fourth quarter of we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately of our worldwide maus our estimation of false accounts can vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as indonesia and vietnam from time to time we disable certain user accounts make product changes or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our users which may also reduce our dau and mau estimates in a particular period we intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts among our maus on an annual basis table of contents the numbers of daus and maus discussed in this annual report on form k as well as arpu do not include users on instagram whatsapp or our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as daus or maus respectively based on their other activities on facebook family metrics many people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual product accordingly for our family metrics we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community rather our family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of facebook instagram messenger and whatsapp we do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our family and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people to calculate these metrics we rely upon complex techniques algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person and counting such group of accounts as one person these techniques and models require significant judgment are subject to data and other limitations discussed below and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties we estimate the potential error in our family metrics primarily based on user survey data which itself is subject to error as well while we expect the error margin for our family metrics to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately  of our worldwide map at our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates potentially beyond our estimated error margins as a result it is also possible that our family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends to calculate our estimates of family dap and map we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data we apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates for example to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products we use data signals such as similar device information ip addresses and user names we also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products which are inherently subject to error the timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed and may in the future contribute to changes in our reported family metrics from period to period in addition our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our family metrics estimates our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others for example as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products we have fewer data signals from whatsapp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match whatsapp user accounts with accounts on our other products similarly although messenger kids users are included in our family metrics we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating dap and map any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating family metrics whether as a result of our own product decisions actions by third party browser or mobile platforms regulatory or legislative requirements limitations while our personnel work remotely during the covid pandemic or other factors also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported family metrics our estimates of family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve including through the application of new data signals or technologies product changes or other improvements in our user surveys algorithms or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users in addition such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts as defined below we regularly evaluate our family metrics to estimate the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating accounts we define violating accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service including bots and spam in the fourth quarter of we estimated that approximately of our worldwide map consisted solely of violating accounts such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example we look for account information and behaviors associated with facebook and instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers but we have limited visibility into whatsapp user activity due to encryption in addition if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account from time to time we disable certain user accounts make product changes or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users which may also reduce our dap and map estimates in a particular period we intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our map consisting solely table of contents of violating accounts on an annual basis violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates the numbers of family dap and map discussed in this annual report on form k as well as arpp do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as dap or map respectively based on their other activities on our family products user geography our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the users ip address and selfdisclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the users actual location for example a user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the users actual location the methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors table of contents part i item business

communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest in addition we have invested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the world intellectual property to establish and protect our proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets including knowhow license agreements confidentiality procedures nondisclosure agreements with third parties employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights in addition to further protect our proprietary rights from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties we do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights we believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products government regulation we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business these laws and regulations involve matters including privacy data use data protection and personal information rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion data localization and storage data disclosure artificial intelligence electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability ecommerce taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions anticorruption and political law compliance securities law compliance and online payment services in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of peoples data foreign data protection privacy content competition and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the united states these us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices for example regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products could adversely affect our financial results in the united states there have been and continue to be various efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under section of the communications decency act and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products business practices or operations which could adversely affect our business and financial results table of contents we are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process andor receive certain data that is critical to our operations including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services it could affect our ability to provide our services the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads which could adversely affect our financial results for example the privacy shield a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the european union to the united states was invalidated in july by the court of justice of the european union cjeu in addition the other bases upon which facebook relies to transfer such data such as standard contractual clauses sccs have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny in august  we received a preliminary draft decision from the irish data protection commission idpc that preliminarily concluded that facebook irelands reliance on sccs in respect of european user data does not achieve compliance with the gdpr and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the european union to the united states should therefore be suspended facebook ireland challenged procedural aspects of this idpc inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the irish high court in september while we also rely upon alternative legal bases for data transfers if a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on sccs or validly rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from europe to the united states we may be unable to operate material portions of our business in europe as a result of the cjeus invalidation of the privacy shield and any final decision of idpc which would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business for example the european general data protection regulation gdpr took effect in may and applies to all of our products and services used by people in europe the gdpr includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the european union that are different from those previously in place in the european union and includes significant penalties for noncompliance the brazilian general data protection law recently took effect and imposes data privacyrelated requirements similar to gdpr on products and services offered to users in brazil the california consumer privacy act which took effect in january also establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users in addition effective december the european unions eprivacy directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and includes significant penalties for noncompliance changes to our products or business practices as a result of these developments may adversely affect our advertising business similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the european union the united states at both the federal and state level as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business such as liability for copyright infringement in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations inquiries data requests requests for information actions and audits by government authorities and regulators in the united states europe and around the world particularly in the areas of privacy data protection law enforcement consumer protection and competition as we continue to grow and expand our operations we are also currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees including the modified consent order we entered into with the us federal trade commission ftc which took effect in april and among other matters requires us to implement a comprehensive expansion of our privacy program orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary remedies interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business result in negative publicity and reputational harm

fail to retain existing users or add new users or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products our revenue financial results and business may be significantly harmed the size of our user base and our users level of engagement are critical to our success our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active users of our products particularly for facebook and instagram we anticipate that our active user growth rate will generally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and we expect that the size of our active user base will fluctuate or decline in one or more markets from time to time particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates for example beginning in the first quarter of we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of the covid pandemic more recently we have seen user growth and engagement returning to prepandemic trends and in each of the third and fourth quarters of we experienced slight declines on a quarteroverquarter basis in the number of daily active users on facebook in the united states canada region we are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty and we expect these trends to continue to be subject to volatility if people do not perceive our products to be useful reliable and trustworthy we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement a number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline in some cases precipitously there is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels our user engagement patterns have changed over time and user engagement can be difficult to measure particularly as we introduce new and different products and services any number of factors can negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if • users increasingly engage with other competitive products or services • we fail to introduce new features products or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services or make changes to existing products and services that are not favorably received • users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency prominence format size and quality of ads that we display • users have difficulty installing updating or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services • user behavior on any of our products changes including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on our products and services table of contents • we are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging that work with a variety of mobile operating systems and networks and that achieve a high level of market acceptance • there are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our user data practices concerns about the nature of content made available on our products or concerns related to privacy safety security wellbeing or other factors • we are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is appropriate interesting useful and relevant to them • we are unable to obtain or attract engaging thirdparty content • we are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products • users adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services or may not be featured or otherwise available • there are changes mandated by legislation government and regulatory authorities or litigation that adversely affect our products or users • we are unable to operate material portions of our business in europe or are otherwise limited in such operations as a result of european regulators courts or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on standard contractual clauses sccs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the european union to the united states is invalid • there is decreased engagement with our products or failure to accept our terms of service as part of privacyfocused changes that we have implemented or may implement in the future whether voluntarily in connection with the general data protection regulation gdpr the european unions eprivacy directive the california consumer privacy act ccpa or other laws regulations or regulatory actions or otherwise • technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content • we adopt terms policies or procedures related to areas such as sharing content user data or advertising or take actions to enforce our policies that are perceived negatively by our users or the general public including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent oversight board regarding content on our platform • we elect to focus our product decisions on longerterm initiatives that do not prioritize nearterm user growth and engagement • we make changes in how we promote different products and services across our family of products • initiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued whether as a result of actions by us third parties or otherwise • thirdparty initiatives that may enable greater use of our products including lowcost or discounted data plans are discontinued • there is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other mobile applications in certain countries internet shutdowns or other actions by governments that affect the accessibility of our products in their countries • we fail to provide adequate customer service to users marketers developers or other partners table of contents • we developers whose products are integrated with our products or other partners and companies in our industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity including as a result of our or their user data practices or • our current or future products such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for our users to interact and share on thirdparty mobile and web applications from time to time certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention growth and engagement to varying degrees if we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement particularly for our significant revenuegenerating products like facebook and instagram our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected any significant decrease in user retention growth or engagement could render our products less attractive to users marketers and developers which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our revenue business financial condition and results of operations if our active user growth rate continues to slow we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising the loss of marketers or reduction in spending by marketers could seriously harm our business substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on facebook and instagram as is common in the industry our marketers do not have longterm advertising commitments with us many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us marketers will not continue to do business with us or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives we have implemented and we will continue to implement changes to our user data practices some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads which has to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business if we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment the pricing of our ads may not increase or may decline in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed our advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors including • decreases in user engagement including time spent on our products • our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products • product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size format frequency or relative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products • our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand the pricing of our ads or both • our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users • changes to thirdparty policies that limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of advertising including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as apple and google • adverse government actions or legislative regulatory or other legal developments relating to advertising including developments that may impact our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of advertising • user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize including as a result of increased usage of the stories format or our messaging products • reductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the security and integrity of our platform table of contents • the availability accuracy utility and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers or our ability to further improve such tools • loss of advertising market share to our competitors including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if competitors offer lower priced more integrated or otherwise more effective products • limitations on our ability to operate material portions of our business in europe as a result of european regulators courts or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on sccs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the european union to the united states is invalid • changes in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of risks related to complying with foreign laws or regulatory requirements or other government actions • decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us our user data practices our advertising metrics or tools content on our products our efforts to implement or enforce policies relating to content on our products including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent oversight board developers with mobile and web applications that are integrated with our products or other companies in our industry • reductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content made available on our products by third parties questions about our user data practices concerns about brand safety or potential legal liability or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligations for example a number of marketers announced that they paused advertising with us in july due to concerns about content on our products • the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt out of the use of data for ads including as a result of product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with the gdpr eprivacy directive california consumer privacy act ccpa other laws regulations or regulatory actions or otherwise that impact our ability to use data for advertising purposes • the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads • changes in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced • the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools • changes in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base and • the impact of macroeconomic conditions whether in the advertising industry in general or among specific types of marketers or within particular geographies from time to time certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees the occurrence of any of these or other factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results for example macroeconomic conditions have affected and may in the future affect marketers ability or willingness to spend with us as we have seen with the regional and worldwide economic disruption related to the covid pandemic and associated declines in advertising activity on our products the effects of the pandemic previously resulted in reduced demand for our ads a related decline in pricing of our ads and additional demands on our technical infrastructure as a result of increased usage of our services and any similar occurrences in the future may impair our ability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users and adversely affect our revenue and financial results table of contents our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control and changes to the regulatory environment thirdparty mobile operating systems and browsers and our own products have impacted and we expect will continue to impact the availability of such signals which will adversely affect our advertising revenue we rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate these signals and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our business for example legislative and regulatory developments such as the gdpr eprivacy directive and ccpa have impacted and we expect will continue to impact our ability to use such signals in our ad products in particular we have seen an increasing number of users opt out of certain types of ad targeting in europe following adoption of the gdpr and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in california following adoption of the ccpa regulatory guidance or decisions or new legislation may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals in addition mobile operating system and browser providers such as apple and google have announced product changes as well as future plans to limit the ability of application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising for example in june apple announced that it plans to make certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with the release of its ios operating system that will reduce our and other ios developers ability to target and measure advertising which we expect will in turn reduce the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms in addition we have implemented and may continue to implement product changes that give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services including our offfacebook activity tool and our worldwide offering of certain product changes we implemented in connection with the gdpr these developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising revenue and if we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected which would in turn significantly impact our future advertising revenue growth our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems networks technologies products and standards that we do not control the substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature facebook or our other products or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products we are dependent on the interoperability of facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems networks technologies products and standards that we do not control such as the android and ios operating systems and mobile browsers any changes bugs or technical issues in such systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners handset manufacturers browser developers or mobile carriers or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products functionality reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products give preferential treatment to competitive products limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads or charge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of facebook or our other products and monetization on mobile devices for example apple previously released an update to its safari browser that limits the use of thirdparty cookies which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization and more recently announced changes to ios that will limit our ability to target and measure ads effectively we expect that any similar changes to its googles or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization additionally in order to deliver high quality mobile products it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies products systems networks and standards that we do not control and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers mobile carriers and browser developers we may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies products systems networks or standards in the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or if our users choose not to access or use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to facebook or our other products our user growth and user engagement could be harmed from time to time we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our longterm best interests such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems handset manufacturers mobile carriers browser developers other business partners or advertisers and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated longterm benefits in the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate our user growth engagement and monetization could be adversely affected table of contents and our business could be harmed we have in the past experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems networks technologies products and standards that we do not control and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile devices which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits our ability to retain increase and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties we may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience for example we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and technologies we continue to incur substantial costs and we may not be successful in generating profits in connection with these efforts in addition the introduction of new products or changes to existing products may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny litigation or other complications that could adversely affect our business and financial results we have also invested and expect to continue to invest significant resources in growing our whatsapp and messenger products to support increasing usage of such products we have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over the long term in addition we are moving forward with plans to implement endtoend encryption across our messaging services as well as facilitate crossapp communication between these platforms which plans have drawn governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions if our new or enhanced products fail to engage users marketers or developers or if our business plans are unsuccessful we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected we make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize shortterm financial results and may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect we frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize shortterm financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term for example we have implemented and we will continue to implement changes to our user data practices some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads which has to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business for example our offfacebook activity tool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers apps and websites which reduces our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective ads to our users similarly from time to time we update our news feed ranking algorithm to optimize the user experience and these changes have had and may in the future have the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with facebook which could adversely affect our financial results from time to time we may also change the size frequency or relative prominence of ads in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience in addition we have made and we expect to continue to make other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers marketers and developers and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on facebook or our other products we also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products or introduce new standalone products that attract users away from properties formats or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization for example we previously introduced the stories format which we do not currently monetize at the same rate as news feed in addition as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products from time to time these efforts have reduced and may in the future reduce engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly these decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands our ability to expand our base of users marketers and developers may be impaired and our business and financial results may be harmed we believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users marketers and developers many of our new users are referred by existing users maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative products which we may not do successfully we may introduce new table of contents products or terms of service or policies that users do not like which may negatively affect our brands additionally the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using thirdparty mobile and web applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products we will also continue to experience media legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy data use encryption content advertising competition and other issues including actions or decisions in connection with elections or the covid‑ pandemic which has in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our reputation and brands for example in march we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies we also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or developers or to otherwise address user concerns which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in our brands our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading or intended to manipulate opinions by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for securityrelated purposes or to censor certain content on our platform by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends including for example any such actions around the pandemic or elections in the united states and around the world by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent oversight board or by our decisions to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who violate our community standards or terms of service maintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful certain of our past actions such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising hate speech and other content have eroded confidence in our brands and if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our business and financial results may be adversely affected we may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products we have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building growing or monetizing mobile andor web applications that create and maintain user engagement additionally developers may choose to build on other platforms including mobile platforms controlled by third parties rather than building products that integrate with facebook and our other products we are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers for example from time to time we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on facebook and our other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience and such actions have reduced distribution from user engagement with and our monetization opportunities from mobile and web applications integrated with our products in addition as part of our efforts related to privacy safety and security we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time and we also have announced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data in some instances these actions as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers have adversely affected or will adversely affect our relationships with developers if we are not successful in our efforts to maintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with facebook and our other products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected risks related to our business operations and financial results the covid pandemic has had and may in the future have a significant adverse impact on our advertising revenue and also exposes our business to other risks the covid pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on business activity quarantines and shelterinplace orders these measures have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas both regionally and worldwide which have significantly impacted our business and results of operations for example in the second quarter of our advertising revenue grew yearoveryear which was the slowest growth rate for any fiscal quarter since our initial public offering while our advertising revenue growth rate improved in subsequent table of contents quarters there can be no assurance that it will not decrease again as a result of the effects of the pandemic in addition we believe that the pandemic has contributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce from offline to online as well as increasing consumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to services which in turn have increased demand for our advertising services however it is possible that this increased demand may not continue in future periods and may even recede as the effects of the pandemic subside which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth the demand for and pricing of our advertising services may be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the foreseeable future and we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such impact with any certainty in addition to the impact on our advertising business the pandemic exposes our business operations and workforce to a variety of other risks including • volatility in the size of our user base and user engagement particularly for our messaging products whether as a result of shelterinplace measures or other factors • decreased user engagement as a result of users inability to purchase data packs or devices to access our products and services • interruptions in the accessibility or performance of our products and services due to capacity constraints from increased usage or product changes we implement to maintain accessibility of our services such as reducing the quality of video to reduce bandwidth usage • delays in product development or releases or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer hardware as a result of inventory shortages supply chain or labor shortages or diversion of our efforts and resources to projects related to covid • increased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties including improper advertising practices or other activity inconsistent with our terms contracts or policies misinformation or other illicit or objectionable material on our platforms election interference or other undesirable activity • adverse impacts to our efforts to combat misuse of our products and services and user data as a result of limitations on our safety security and content review efforts while our workforce is working remotely such as the necessity to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence to perform tasks that our workforce is unable to perform • our inability to recognize revenue collect payment or generate future revenue from marketers including from those that have been or may be forced to close their businesses or are otherwise impacted by the economic downturn • increased expenses resulting from our initiatives or donations related to the pandemic • significant volatility and disruption of global financial markets which could cause fluctuations in currency exchange rates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future • negative impact on our workforce productivity product development and research and development due to difficulties resulting from our personnel working remotely • illnesses to key employees or a significant portion of our workforce which may result in inefficiencies delays and disruptions in our business and • increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our financial statements any of these developments may adversely affect our business harm our reputation or result in legal or regulatory actions against us the persistence of covid and the preventative measures implemented to help limit the spread of the illness have impacted and will continue to impact our ability to operate our business and may materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations our business is highly competitive competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business we compete with companies providing connection and communication products and services to users online as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers andor develop tools and systems for managing table of contents and optimizing advertising campaigns we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including but not limited to companies that facilitate the ability of users to share communicate and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences including for example google apple youtube tencent snap twitter bytedance microsoft and amazon we compete to attract engage and retain people who use our products to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services and to attract and retain developers who build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our products we also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual reality products and services as we introduce or acquire new products as our existing products evolve or as other companies introduce new products and services we may become subject to additional competition some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments geographic regions or user demographics than we do for example some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political legal and regulatory regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us these factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions we believe that some users particularly younger users are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to or as a substitute for our products and services and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement with our products and services in favor of these other products and services in the event that users increasingly engage with other products and services we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly in which case our business would likely be harmed our competitors may develop products features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more farreaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate including by making acquisitions by limiting our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads by making access to our products more difficult or impossible by making it more difficult to communicate with our users or by integrating competing platforms applications or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems search engines browsers or ecommerce platforms for example each of apple and google have integrated competitive products with ios and android respectively in addition apple has announced changes to ios that will limit our ability and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry to target and measure ads effectively as a result our competitors may and in some cases will acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts which would negatively affect our business and financial results in addition from time to time we may take actions in response to competitive threats but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including • the popularity usefulness ease of use performance and reliability of our products compared to our competitors products • the size and composition of our user base • the engagement of users with our products and competing products • our ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services • the timing and market acceptance of products including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors products • our safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their data • our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users • our ability to monetize our products table of contents • the frequency size format quality and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors • customer service and support efforts • marketing and selling efforts including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on their investments • our ability to establish and maintain developers interest in building mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products • our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with facebook and our other products • changes mandated by legislation regulatory authorities or litigation some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us • acquisitions or consolidation within our industry which may result in more formidable competitors • our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees particularly software engineers designers and product managers • our ability to costeffectively manage and grow our operations and • our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors if we are not able to compete effectively our user base and level of user engagement may decrease we may become less attractive to developers and marketers and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected unfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business from time to time we receive a high degree of media coverage around the world unfavorable publicity regarding for example our privacy practices terms of service advertising policies product changes product quality litigation or regulatory activity government surveillance the actions of our advertisers the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends the substance or enforcement of our community standards the actions of our users the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to ours has in the past and could in the future adversely affect our reputation for example we have been the subject of significant media coverage involving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising hate speech and other content and we continue to receive negative publicity related to these topics in addition we have been and may in the future be subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit or objectionable use of our products or services including in connection with the covid pandemic and elections in the united states and around the world any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our products which could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results and we have experienced such adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future additionally we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business which makes it difficult to forecast our future results as a result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance you should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including • our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement table of contents • our ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period • our ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers in a particular period including as a result of the effects of the covid pandemic • fluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality such as historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year episodic regional or global events including the covid pandemic or other factors • the frequency prominence size format and quality of ads shown to users • the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads • changes to thirdparty policies that limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of advertising including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as apple and google • the pricing of our ads and other products • the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on facebook and instagram • our ability to generate revenue from payments or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we may introduce in the future • changes to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors • user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize • increases in marketing sales and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive including costs related to our data centers and technical infrastructure • costs related to our privacy safety security and content review efforts including as a result of implementing changes to our practices whether voluntarily in connection with laws regulations regulatory actions or decisions or recommendations from the independent oversight board or otherwise • costs and expenses related to the development and delivery of our consumer hardware products • our ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins • costs related to acquisitions including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop the acquired technologies • charges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet • our ability to obtain equipment components and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in a timely and costeffective manner • system failures or outages or government blocking which could prevent us from serving ads for any period of time • breaches of security or privacy and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation • changes in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to thirdparty actions • fees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products table of contents • refunds or other concessions provided to advertisers • sharebased compensation expense including acquisitionrelated expense • adverse litigation judgments settlements or other litigationrelated costs • changes in the legislative or regulatory environment including with respect to privacy and data protection or actions by governments or regulators including fines orders or consent decrees • the overall tax rate for our business which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the us and in jurisdictions with different tax rates the effects of sharebased compensation the effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions the effects of changes in our business or structure and the effects of discrete items such as legal and tax settlements and tax elections • the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws which are recorded in the period such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period • tax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations including the examination we are currently under by the internal revenue service irs that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated • fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies • trading activity in our share repurchase program • fluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities in the valuation of our equity investments and in interest rates • changes in us generally accepted accounting principles and • changes in regional or global business or macroeconomic conditions including as a result of the covid pandemic which may impact the other factors described above we expect our rates of growth to be volatile in the near term as a result of the covid pandemic and to decline over time in the future we expect our user and revenue growth rates to be volatile in the near term as a result of the covid pandemic although we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such volatility with any certainty in the long term we expect that our user growth rate will generally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more markets particularly as we achieve greater market penetration we also expect our revenue growth rate will continue to decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels as our growth rates experience volatility or decline investors perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our class a common stock could decline our costs are continuing to grow and some of our investments particularly our investments in virtual and augmented reality have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability if our investments are not successful longerterm our business and financial performance will be harmed operating our business is costly and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us for example with respect to video as we develop and implement new products as we market new and existing products and promote our brands as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure as we continue to invest in new and unproven technologies and as we continue to hire additional employees and contractors to support our expanding operations including our efforts to focus on privacy safety security and content review in addition from time to time we are subject to settlements judgments table of contents fines or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and regulatory developments that may be material to our business we are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies some of these investments particularly our significant investments in virtual and augmented reality have generated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability and we expect the adverse financial impact of such investments to continue for the foreseeable future if our investments are not successful longerterm our business and financial performance will be harmed we plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock as part of our business strategy we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies products or technologies and from time to time may enter into other strategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms if at all including as a result of regulatory challenges in some cases the costs of such acquisitions or other strategic transactions may be substantial and there is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on investment for our acquisitions or other strategic transactions we may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions which has occurred in the past and could adversely affect our liquidity the incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations we may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant rsus to retain the employees of acquired companies which could increase our expenses adversely affect our financial results and result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any acquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users marketers developers or investors which may adversely affect our business or the price of our class a common stock we may also discover liabilities deficiencies or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance which may result in significant unanticipated costs the effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed in addition we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other strategic transaction including tax and accounting charges acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and we incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire the integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources and we may not manage these processes successfully our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisitions is unproven particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience we continue to make substantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions which will result in significant ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful if we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service including as a result of the covid pandemic could damage our reputation result in a potential loss of users and engagement and adversely affect our financial results our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to time our systems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business if our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them or if they do not load as quickly as expected users may not use our products as often in the future or at all and our ability to serve ads may be table of contents disrupted any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance as the amount and types of information shared on facebook and our other products continue to grow and evolve as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve and as our internal operational demands continue to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy our needs it is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue growth in addition our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures resulting from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters power loss terrorism geopolitical conflict other physical security threats cyberattacks or other catastrophic events if such an event were to occur users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services which may adversely affect our financial results for example the increase in the use of our products as a result of the covid pandemic increased demands on our technical infrastructure additional product development efforts during this time have put additional pressure on our technical infrastructure we may not be able to accommodate these demands including as a result of our reduced data center operations and personnel working remotely during the pandemic a substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide the effects of the covid pandemic have increased the risk of supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logistics or the supply chain for our technical infrastructure as a result we may not be able to procure sufficient equipment or services from third parties to satisfy our needs or we may be required to procure such services or equipment on unfavorable terms any of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products require unfavorable changes to existing products delay the introduction of future products or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results we could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure we have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems and other projects the infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world including in emerging markets that expose us to increased risks relating to anticorruption compliance and political challenges among others we have in the past suspended and may in the future suspend certain of these projects as a result of the covid pandemic additional unanticipated delays or disruptions in the completion of these projects including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects or availability of components challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals or other geopolitical challenges or actions by governments whether as a result of the pandemic trade disputes or otherwise may lead to increased project costs operational inefficiencies interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality or reliability of our products or impairment of assets on our balance sheet in addition there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs further much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the united states and it is possible that action by a foreign government or our response to such government action could result in the impairment of a portion of our technical infrastructure which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the quality or reliability of our products and lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs any of these events could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results real or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business the numbers for our key metrics which include our facebook metrics daus maus and average revenue per user arpu and family metrics dap map and average revenue per person arpp are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world the methodologies used to measure these metrics require table of contents significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors in addition we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments we generally do not intend to update previously disclosed family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below in addition our facebook metrics and family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology we regularly evaluate our facebook metrics to estimate the number of duplicate and false accounts among our maus a duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account we divide false accounts into two categories usermisclassified accounts where users have created personal profiles for a business organization or nonhuman entity such as a pet such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service and violating accounts which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service such as bots and spam the estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical ip addresses and similar user names and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers any loss of access to data signals we use in this process whether as a result of our own product decisions actions by thirdparty browser or mobile platforms regulatory or legislative requirements limitations while our personnel work remotely during the covid pandemic or other factors also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve including through the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates in the fourth quarter of we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the philippines and vietnam as compared to more developed markets in the fourth quarter of we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately of our worldwide maus our estimation of false accounts can vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as indonesia and vietnam from time to time we disable certain user accounts make product changes or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our users which may also reduce our dau and mau estimates in a particular period we intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts among our maus on an annual basis many people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual product accordingly for our family metrics we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community rather our family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of facebook instagram messenger and whatsapp we do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our family and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people to calculate these metrics we rely upon complex techniques algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person and counting such group of accounts as one person these techniques and models require significant judgment are subject to data and other limitations discussed below and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties we estimate the potential error in our family metrics primarily based on user survey data which itself is subject to error as well while we expect the error margin for our family metrics to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately  of our worldwide map at our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates potentially beyond our estimated error margins as a result it is also possible that our family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends table of contents to calculate our estimates of family dap and map we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data we apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates for example to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products we use data signals such as similar device information ip addresses and user names we also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products which are inherently subject to error the timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed and may in the future contribute to changes in our reported family metrics from period to period in addition our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our family metrics estimates our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others for example as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products we have fewer data signals from whatsapp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match whatsapp user accounts with accounts on our other products similarly although messenger kids users are included in our family metrics we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating dap and map any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating family metrics whether as a result of our own product decisions actions by third party browser or mobile platforms regulatory or legislative requirements limitations while our personnel work remotely during the covid pandemic or other factors also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported family metrics our estimates of family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve including through the application of new data signals or technologies product changes or other improvements in our user surveys algorithms or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users in addition such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts as defined below we regularly evaluate our family metrics to estimate the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating accounts we define violating accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service including bots and spam in the fourth quarter of we estimated that approximately of our worldwide map consisted solely of violating accounts such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example we look for account information and behaviors associated with facebook and instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers but we have limited visibility into whatsapp user activity due to encryption in addition if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account from time to time we disable certain user accounts make product changes or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users which may also reduce our dap and map estimates in a particular period we intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates other data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business for example while userprovided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the users ip address and self disclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the users actual location for example a user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the users actual location the methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors in addition from time to time we provide or rely on certain other metrics and estimates including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and judgments and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs inconsistencies in our systems and human error where marketers developers or investors do not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate or where we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics or estimates we may be subject to liability our reputation may be harmed and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to facebook or our other products which could negatively affect our business and financial results table of contents we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employees increasing to as of december  from as of december  and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future in addition we plan to continue to hire a number of employees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy safety security and content review initiatives as well as other functions to support our expected growth the growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management operational and financial resources including managing multiple relationships with users marketers developers and other third parties as our operations and the number of our thirdparty relationships continue to grow our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support such growth in addition some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively additionally the vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely as a result of the covid pandemic which limits their ability to perform certain job functions and may negatively impact productivity in the long term we may experience such challenges to productivity and collaboration as some personnel transition to working remotely on a regular basis and we may experience difficulties integrating recently hired personnel when our offices reopen to effectively manage our growth we must continue to adapt to a remote work environment improve our operational financial and management processes and systems and effectively expand train and manage our personnel as our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products this could negatively affect our business performance we have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have more limited operating experience and this may subject us to increased business economic and legal risks that could affect our financial results we have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products we currently make facebook available in more than different languages and we have offices or data centers in more than different countries we may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing selling and deploying our products our products are generally available globally but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities for example facebook and certain of our other products are not generally available in china we also outsource certain operational functions to thirdparty vendors globally if we fail to deploy manage or oversee our international operations successfully our business may suffer in addition we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally including • political social or economic instability • risks related to legal regulatory and other government scrutiny applicable to us companies with sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions including with respect to privacy tax law enforcement content trade compliance competition consumer protection intellectual property and infrastructure matters • potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws including potential censorship or requirements to provide user information to local authorities • enhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different languages and countries • fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls • foreign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the united states or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently • higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud table of contents • enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions • burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws including laws related to taxation content removal data localization payments and regulatory oversight • reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries • difficulties in staffing managing and overseeing global operations and the increased travel infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations including difficulties arising from personnel working remotely during the covid pandemic • compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences and • geopolitical events affecting us our marketers or our industry including trade disputes and pandemics in addition we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given jurisdiction and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations including anticorruption laws or regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act we also must manage our obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to export controls sanctions and embargoes including regulations established by the us office of foreign assets control government agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for violations of anticorruption laws or regulations export controls and other laws rules sanctions embargoes and regulations if we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully our financial results could be adversely affected we face design manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial results we face a number of risks related to design manufacturing and supply chain management with respect to our consumer hardware products for example the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had and in the future may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products or from the software used in the products sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues other failures to meet our customers expectations or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective we rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products which subjects us to a number of risks that have been exacerbated as a result of the covid pandemic we may experience supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logistics or the supply chain that could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations product development and sales we could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties manufacturing constraints or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them the manufacturing distribution and sale of our consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions geopolitical challenges trade disputes or other actions by governments that subject us to supply shortages increased costs or supply chain disruptions we also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and certain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor health and safety the environment and business ethics but we do not control them or their practices and standards if any of them violates laws fails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical corrupt or noncompliant we could experience supply chain disruptions government action or fines canceled orders or damage to our reputation we face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products we are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in table of contents product cycles and pricing unsafe or defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products and other factors the demand for our products can also change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale while we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer hardware products we may sell from time to time we have experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international markets it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable any one of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our operating results we are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm our business financial condition or results of operations we are involved in numerous lawsuits including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits many of which claim statutory damages andor seek significant changes to our business operations and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future because of the scale of our user advertiser and developer base the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged peruser or entity harm is small or nonexistent in addition we have in the past and may in the future be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on claims related to advertising antitrust privacy content employment or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and software as well as virtual reality technology and products which are new and unproven for example we are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of  and our acquisitions of instagram and whatsapp as well as other alleged anticompetitive conduct we also agreed to settle certain lawsuits in connection with the tag suggestions facial recognition feature on facebook and a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on facebook the results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or undesirable changes to our products or business practices and accordingly our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms which has occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business financial conditions or results of operations we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities our tax obligations including income and nonincome taxes are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we operate our business develop value manage protect and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions the tax laws applicable to our business including the laws of the united states and other jurisdictions are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as facebook we are subject to regular review and audit by us federal state and foreign tax authorities tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken including our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of nonincome taxes imposed on our business and harm our financial position results of operations and cash flows for example in and the irs issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the through tax years although we disagree with the irss position and are litigating this issue the ultimate resolution is uncertain and if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us may adversely affect our financial results the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate although we believe that our provision for income taxes and estimates of table of contents our nonincome tax liabilities are reasonable the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made our future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit split changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows the tax regimes we are subject to or operate under including income and nonincome taxes are unsettled and may be subject to significant change changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing laws could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows for example the tax cuts and jobs act tax act enacted in december had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of the issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the tax act or other executive or congressional actions in the united states could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such actions take effect in addition many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business the organization for economic cooperation and development has been working on a base erosion and profit shifting project and issued a report in an interim report in and blueprints in that if implemented would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business similarly the european commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed these proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax as well as proposals to change or impose new types of nonincome taxes including taxes based on a percentage of revenue for example several countries have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services which includes business activities on social media platforms and online marketplaces and which apply to our business the european commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries including ireland have provided illegal state aid in certain cases these investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of nonincome taxes imposed on our business and harm our financial position results of operations and cash flows such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements given our levels of sharebased compensation our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price the tax effects of the accounting for sharebased compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period in periods in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the sharebased compensation vesting in that period we will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease our effective tax rate for example in excess tax benefits recognized from sharebased compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by million and our effective tax rate by two percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such benefits in future periods in which our stock price is lower than the grant price of the sharebased compensation vesting in that period our effective tax rate may increase the amount and value of sharebased compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of sharebased compensation on our effective tax rate these tax effects are dependent on our stock price which we do not control and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results table of contents if our goodwill or finitelived intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings we review our finitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization we test goodwill for impairment at least annually if such goodwill or finitelived intangible assets are deemed to be impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finitelived intangible assets is determined which would negatively affect our results of operations the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl k sandberg although we have entered into employment agreements with mr zuckerberg and ms sandberg the agreements have no specific duration and constitute atwill employment in addition many of our key technologies and systems are custommade for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel including members of management as well as key engineering product development marketing and sales personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business as we continue to grow we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position in particular we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future and we expect to continue to face significant challenges in hiring such personnel particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located whether as a result of competition with other companies challenges due to the high cost of living facilities and infrastructure constraints or other factors as we continue to mature the incentives to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees we would incur substantial additional sharebased compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted our ability to attract retain and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility as a result of these factors it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our employees if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively our ceo has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and ceo is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets this concentrated control could delay defer or prevent a change of control merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our class a common stock which has limited voting power relative to the class b common stock and might harm the trading price of our class a common stock in addition mr zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our ceo and his ability to control the election or in some cases the replacement of our directors in the event of his death the shares of our capital stock that mr zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated as a board member and officer mr zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders as a stockholder even a controlling stockholder mr zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement in his own interests which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves table of contents although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our class a common stock we cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value the program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock in addition this program will diminish our cash reserves risks related to government regulation and enforcement actions by governments that restrict access to facebook or our other products in their countries or that otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results governments from time to time seek to censor content available on facebook or our other products in their country restrict access to our products from their country entirely or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely for example user access to facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in china iran and north korea in addition government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from time to time for example in june hong kong adopted a national security law that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information remove and block access to content and suspend user services and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted in addition if we are required to or elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other operations in hong kong as a result of the national security law our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected it is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising including in countries where access to our consumerfacing products may be blocked or restricted for example we generate meaningful revenue from a limited number of resellers representing advertisers based in china and it is possible that the chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our chinabased advertising revenue whether as a result of the trade dispute with the united states in response to content issues or information requests in hong kong or elsewhere or for other reasons or take other action against us such as imposing taxes or other penalties which could adversely affect our financial results similarly if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for social media companies in turkey the turkish government could take action to reduce or eliminate our turkeybased advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products in the event that content shown on facebook or our other products is subject to censorship access to our products is restricted in whole or in part in one or more countries we are required to or elect to make changes to our operations or other restrictions are imposed on our products or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions our ability to retain or increase our user base user engagement or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated and our financial results could be adversely affected our business is subject to complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data use and data protection content competition consumer protection and other matters many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to our business practices monetary penalties increased cost of operations or declines in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business including privacy data use data protection and personal information rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion data localization and storage data disclosure artificial intelligence electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability ecommerce taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions anticorruption and political law compliance securities law compliance and online payment services the introduction of new products expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws regulations or other government scrutiny in addition foreign data protection privacy content competition and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the united states these us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and table of contents rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices for example regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results we are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process andor receive certain data that is critical to our operations including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services for example in the european union and united states agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the european union to the united states called the privacy shield but the privacy shield was invalidated in july by the court of justice of the european union cjeu in addition the other bases upon which facebook relies to transfer such data such as standard contractual clauses sccs have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny for example the cjeu considered the validity of sccs as a basis to transfer user data from the european union to the united states following a challenge brought by the irish data protection commission idpc although the cjeu upheld the validity of sccs in july our continued reliance on sccs is contingent on sccs being held to satisfy certain new conditions that are yet to be clearly defined and will be the subject of future regulatory guidance and the european commission has recently proposed new sccs which are currently subject to consultation in addition in august we received a preliminary draft decision from the idpc that preliminarily concluded that facebook irelands reliance on sccs in respect of european user data does not achieve compliance with the gdpr and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the european union to the united states should therefore be suspended facebook ireland challenged procedural aspects of this idpc inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the irish high court in september and the court ordered the idpc not to take further steps in respect of the inquiry until the judicial review proceedings conclude subject to the idpcs right to apply to vary or lift this order which we expect to occur in the coming months while we also rely upon alternative legal bases for data transfers if a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on sccs or validly rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from europe to the united states we may be unable to operate material portions of our business in europe as a result of the cjeus invalidation of the privacy shield and any final decision of idpc which would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we have also been managing investigations and lawsuits in europe india and other jurisdictions regarding the august update to whatsapps terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other facebook products and services including a lawsuit currently pending before the supreme court of india if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services it could affect our ability to provide our services the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads which could adversely affect our financial results proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business for example the european general data protection regulation gdpr took effect in may and applies to all of our products and services used by people in europe the gdpr includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the european union that are different from those previously in place in the european union as a result we implemented measures to change our service for minors under the age of for certain countries in europe that maintain the minimum age of under the gdpr we also obtain consent andor offer new controls to existing and new users in europe before processing data for certain aspects of our service in addition the gdpr requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our designated european privacy regulator the idpc and includes significant penalties for noncompliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation similarly the brazilian general data protection law recently took effect and imposes data privacyrelated requirements on products and services offered to users in brazil the california consumer privacy act ccpa which took effect in january also establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users including more ability to control how their data is shared with third parties these laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation and resulting limitations on our advertising services or reductions of advertising by marketers have to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business for example regulators have recently issued new guidance concerning the eprivacy directives requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies in addition effective december the eprivacy directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and includes significant penalties for noncompliance changes to our products or business practices as a result of these developments may adversely affect our advertising business similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the european union the united states at both the federal and state level as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services table of contents these laws and regulations as well as any associated claims inquiries or investigations or any other government actions have in the past led to and may in the future lead to unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs delays or impediments in the development of new products negative publicity and reputational harm increased operating costs diversion of management time and attention and remedies that harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices we have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations enforcement actions and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business from time to time we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations inquiries data requests requests for information actions and audits in the united states europe and around the world particularly in the areas of privacy data protection law enforcement consumer protection and competition as we continue to grow and expand our operations in addition we are currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees for example data protection competition and consumer protection authorities in the european union and other jurisdictions have initiated actions investigations or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information or impose sanctions and other authorities may do the same in addition beginning in march we became subject to ftc state attorneys general and other government inquiries in the united states europe and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies in july we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the ftc inquiry which was approved by the federal court and took effect in april among other matters our settlement with the ftc required us to pay a penalty of billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight beginning in september we also became subject to idpc and other government inquiries in connection with a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on facebook from time to time we also notify the idpc our designated european privacy regulator under the gdpr of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues and are subject to inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance in addition from time to time we are subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities in the united states europe and other jurisdictions which relate to many aspects of our business including with respect to users and advertisers as well as our industry such inquiries investigations and lawsuits concern among other things our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services digital advertising andor mobile or online applications as well as past acquisitions for example in june we were informed by the ftc that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company in addition beginning in the third quarter of we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the us department of justice the us house of representatives and state attorneys general in december the ftc and the attorneys general from states the territory of guam and the district of columbia filed complaints against us in the us district court for the district of columbia alleging that we violated antitrust laws by acquiring instagram in and whatsapp in and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform among other things the lawsuits of the ftc and attorneys general both seek a permanent injunction against our companys alleged violations of the antitrust laws and other equitable relief including divestiture or reconstruction of instagram and whatsapp orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary remedies interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business result in negative publicity and reputational harm divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time table of contents compliance with our ftc consent order the gdpr the ccpa the eprivacy directive and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and financial results we are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts including in connection with our modified consent order with the ftc requirements of the gdpr and other regulatory and legislative requirements around the world such as the ccpa and the eprivacy directive in particular we are implementing a comprehensive expansion of our privacy program in connection with the ftc consent order including substantial management and board of directors oversight stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data a process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the ftc and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent thirdparty assessor which has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to implement these compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources and require significant new and ongoing investments including investments in compliance processes personnel and technical infrastructure we are reallocating resources internally to assist with these efforts and this has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our other business initiatives in addition these efforts require substantial modifications to our business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult timeconsuming and costly as a result we believe our ability to develop and launch new features products and services in a timely manner has been and will continue to be adversely affected we also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight efforts will require significant time and attention from our management and board of directors the requirements of the ftc consent order and other privacyrelated laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business and from time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues and we expect to continue to do so as any such issues arise in the future in addition regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation if we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the ftc consent order gdpr ccpa eprivacy directive or other regulatory or legislative requirements or if we are found to be in violation of the consent order or other applicable requirements we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations or lawsuits which may result in significant monetary fines judgments or other penalties and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and financial results we may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products and legislation regulating content on our platform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and financial results we have faced currently face and will continue to face claims relating to information or content that is published or made available on our products including our policies and enforcement actions with respect to such information or content in particular the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes discrimination harassment intellectual property rights rights of publicity and privacy personal injury torts laws regulating hate speech or other types of content and breach of contract among others this risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the united states where our protection from liability for thirdparty actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the united states for example in april the european union passed a directive expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online which member states are required to implement by june  in addition the european union revised the european audiovisual media service directive to apply to online videosharing platforms which member states are expected to implement by in the united states there have been and continue to be various congressional and executive efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under section of the communications decency act as well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings counterfeit goods and copyrightinfringing material and our current protections from liability for thirdparty content in the united states could decrease or change we could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and if we are found liable significant damages we could also face fines orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies or other governmentimposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services for example legislation in germany has in the past and may in the future result in the imposition of fines for failure to comply with certain content removal law enforcement cooperation and disclosure obligations numerous other countries in europe asiapacific and latin america are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing penalties including fines service throttling or advertising bans for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes for example we have been subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in turkey in addition australia recently announced proposed legislation that would among other matters require us to pay publishers for certain table of contents news content that is shared on facebook and instagram contentrelated legislation also has required us in the past and may require us in the future to change our products or business practices increase our compliance costs or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies for example the european copyright directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the availability of that content which may require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes in addition changes to section  of the communications decency act may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products business practices or operations which could adversely affect user growth and engagement any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results payment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business our users can purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our payments infrastructure on the facebook website in addition certain of our users can use our payments infrastructure including on messenger and whatsapp for other activities such as sending money to other users and making donations to certain charitable organizations we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and elsewhere including those governing antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfer charitable fundraising and import and export restrictions depending on how our payments product evolves we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling banking and lending in some jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and an electronic money emoney license that allows us to conduct certain regulated payment activities in the participating member countries of the european economic area which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance in the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order or we may be required to make product changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results in addition we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of payments transactions including increased costs and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or customer disputes potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users developers employees or third parties restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact payments and additional disclosure and reporting requirements we have also launched certain payments functionality on whatsapp and have announced plans to develop digital payments products and services which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements our participation in the diem association subjects us to significant regulatory scrutiny and other risks that could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results in june we announced our participation in the diem association which will oversee a proposed digital payments system powered by blockchain technology and our plans for novi a digital wallet for diem which we expect to launch as a standalone application and subsequently in messenger and whatsapp diem is based on relatively new and unproven technology and the laws and regulations surrounding blockchainbased payments are uncertain and evolving diem has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue as a sponsor of the initiative and a proposed digital wallet service provider we are participating in responses to inquiries from governments and regulators and adverse government or regulatory actions or negative publicity resulting from such participation may adversely affect our reputation and harm our business as this initiative evolves both diem and novi may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and international jurisdictions including those governing payments financial services antimoney laundering counterterrorism financing economic sanctions data protection tax and competition in many jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear particularly with respect to evolving laws and regulations that are applied to blockchain and digital payments to mitigate regulatory uncertainty diem has applied for a payment system operator license with the swiss financial market supervisory authority finma and novi has applied for money table of contents transmitter licenses in the united states and certain other countries and other financial services licenses in certain other countries that would allow us to conduct digital wallet activities in these countries using the diem network these licenses laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries or investigations may delay or impede the launch of the diem digital payments system as well as the development of our products and services increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention or otherwise harm our business in addition market acceptance of such a digital payments system is subject to significant uncertainty as such there can be no assurance that diem or our associated products and services will be made available in a timely manner or at all we do not have significant prior experience with blockchainbased payments technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and services we will also incur increased costs in connection with our participation in the diem association and the development and marketing of associated products and services and our investments may not be successful any of these events could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results risks related to data security and intellectual property security breaches improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business our industry is prone to cyberattacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users data or to disrupt our ability to provide service our products and services involve the collection storage processing and transmission of a large amount of data any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data including personal information content or payment information from users or information from marketers could result in the loss modification disclosure destruction or other misuse of such data which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position in addition computer malware viruses social engineering predominantly spear phishing attacks scraping and general hacking have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and will occur on our systems in the future we also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts purchase ads or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming spreading misinformation or other objectionable ends as a result of our prominence the size of our user base the types and volume of personal data and content on our systems and the evolving nature of our products and services including our efforts involving new and emerging technologies we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks including from nation states and highly sophisticated statesponsored or otherwise wellfunded actors our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide degrade the user experience cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products impair our internal systems or result in financial harm to us our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive and to disable undesirable activities on our platform may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions employee contractor or vendor error or malfeasance including defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors information technology systems or offerings government surveillance breaches of physical security of our facilities or technical infrastructure or other threats that evolve in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users data cyberattacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data to prevent data loss to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform and to prevent or detect security breaches we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security that we will be able to react in a timely manner or that our remediation efforts will be successful in addition some of our developers or other partners such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads may receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with facebook we provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us however if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or in the event of a breach of their networks our data or our users data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed we experience such cyberattacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time and we incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents in addition we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection as well as obligations under our modified consent order with the ftc as a result affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of data table of contents which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business reputation or financial results for example in september we announced our discovery of a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access tokens which were then used to access certain profile information from approximately million user accounts on facebook the events surrounding this cyberattack became the subject of irish data protection commission and other government inquiries any such inquiries could subject us to substantial fines and costs require us to change our business practices divert resources and the attention of management from our business or adversely affect our business in addition the changes in our work environment as a result of the covid pandemic could impact the security of our systems as well as our ability to protect against attacks and detect and respond to them quickly the rapid adoption of some thirdparty services designed to enable the transition to a remote workforce also may introduce security risk that is not fully mitigated prior to the use of these services we may also be subject to increased cyberattacks such as phishing attacks by threat actors using the attention placed on the pandemic as a method for targeting our personnel we anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy safety security and content review will identify additional instances of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform in addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks we are making significant investments in privacy safety security and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties including investigations and audits of platform applications as a result of these efforts we have discovered and announced and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce additional incidents of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties we may not discover all such incidents or activity whether as a result of our data or technical limitations including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services the scale of activity on our platform challenges related to our personnel working remotely during the covid pandemic the allocation of resources to other projects or other factors and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy assessor required under our modified consent order with the ftc the media or other third parties such incidents and activities have in the past and may in the future include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms contracts or policies the existence of false or undesirable user accounts election interference improper advertising practices activities that threaten peoples safety on or offline or instances of spamming scraping data harvesting unsecured datasets or spreading misinformation we may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement harm our reputation and brands require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and adversely affect our business and financial results any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages divert managements time and attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and any errors bugs or vulnerabilities in these systems or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems could adversely affect our business our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware including software and hardware developed or maintained internally andor by third parties that is highly technical and complex in addition our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store retrieve process and manage immense amounts of data the software and hardware on which we rely has contained and will in the future contain errors bugs or vulnerabilities and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives some errors bugs or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use for example in september we announced our discovery of a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on facebook errors bugs vulnerabilities design defects or technical limitations within the software and hardware on which we rely have in the past led to and may in the future lead to outcomes including a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products compromised ability of our products to perform in a manner consistent with our terms contracts or policies delayed product introductions or enhancements targeting measurement or billing errors compromised ability to protect the data of our users andor our intellectual property or other data or reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services for example we make commitments to our users as to how their data will table of contents be used within and across our products and our systems are subject to errors bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably in addition any errors bugs vulnerabilities or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely failures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users have in the past led to and may in the future lead to outcomes including damage to our reputation loss of users loss of marketers loss of revenue regulatory inquiries litigation or liability for fines damages or other remedies any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results if we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality assignment and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection laws to protect our proprietary rights in the united states and internationally we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property and we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business in any or all of these cases we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business in addition we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses and we include open source software in our products as a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products we may license or be required to license or disclose code andor innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products services and methods of operations any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations companies in the internet technology and media industries own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights in addition various non practicing entities that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies furthermore from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products including in areas where we historically have not competed which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and nonpracticing entities from time to time we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services or user content infringe their intellectual property rights we presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases in addition plaintiffs may seek and we may become subject to preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations we may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us similarly if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal the terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party in addition we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third partys rights which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses as a result we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology or table of contents practices or discontinue the practices the development of alternative noninfringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense could result in less effective technology or practices or otherwise negatively affect the user experience or may not be feasible we have experienced unfavorable outcomes in such disputes and litigation in the past and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above risks related to ownership of our class a common stock the trading price of our class a common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile the trading price of our class a common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile since shares of our class a common stock were sold in our initial public offering in may at a price of per share our stock price has ranged from to through december  in addition to the factors discussed in this annual report on form k the trading price of our class a common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results • the financial projections we may provide to the public any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections • actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors • additional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us our existing stockholders or in connection with acquisitions or the anticipation of such sales • investor sentiment with respect to our competitors our business partners and our industry in general • announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features technical innovations acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments • announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base the level of user engagement or the effectiveness of our ad products • changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry including our developers and competitors • price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole • the inclusion exclusion or deletion of our stock from any trading indices such as the sp index • media coverage of our business and financial performance • lawsuits threatened or filed against us or developments in pending lawsuits • adverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising competition content privacy or other matters including interim or final rulings by tax judicial or regulatory bodies • trading activity in our share repurchase program and • other events or factors including those resulting from war incidents of terrorism pandemics and other disruptive external events or responses to these events table of contents in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies we are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies as well as the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business we do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and fund our share repurchase program and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our class a common stock if the trading price of your shares increases the dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our ceo and certain other holders of our class b common stock this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters our class b common stock has ten votes per share and our class a common stock has one vote per share stockholders who hold shares of class b common stock including certain of our executive officers employees and directors and their affiliates together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock because of the tentoone voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock the holders of our class b common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of class b common stock represent at least  of all outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock this concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock subject to limited exceptions such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect over time of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term if for example mr zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of class b common stock for an extended period of time he could in the future continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price because we qualify as a controlled company under the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function in the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function accordingly should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult thereby depressing the trading price of our class a common stock our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our current restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult including the following • until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than of the table of contents combined voting power of our common stock any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding class b common stock voting as a separate class • we currently have a dual class common stock structure which provides mr zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding class a and class b common stock • when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval of twothirds of the combined vote of our then outstanding shares of class a and class b common stock • when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders • when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered threeyear terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause • when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent • only our chairman our chief executive officer our president or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders • advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders • our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and • certain litigation against us can only be brought in delaware table of contents item b unresolved staff comments none item properties our corporate headquarters are located in menlo park california as of december  we

in july we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the ftc inquiry which was approved by the federal court and took effect in april among other matters our settlement with the

protection commission idpc and other government inquiries any such inquiries could subject us to substantial fines and costs require us to change our business practices divert resources and the attention of management from our business or adversely affect our business from time to time we also notify the idpc our designated european privacy regulator under the general data protection regulation of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues and are subject to inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance for example in august  we received a preliminary draft decision from the idpc that preliminarily concluded that facebook irelands reliance on standard contractual clauses in respect of european user data does not achieve compliance with the gdpr and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the european union to the united states should therefore be suspended facebook ireland challenged procedural aspects of this idpc inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the irish high court in september and the court ordered the idpc not to take further steps in respect of the inquiry until the judicial

other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive conduct and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief we believe these lawsuits are without merit

business practices divert resources and the attention of management from our business or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business in addition from time to time we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies including in particular in brazil and europe in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies including our obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances a number of such instances have resulted in the

in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap this measure may be different from non‑gaap financial measures used by other companies limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes moreover presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for yearoveryear comparison purposes and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results we believe this nongaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business executive overview of full year results our key community metrics and financial results for are as follows community growth • facebook daily active users daus were billion on average for december an increase of yearoveryear • facebook monthly active users maus were billion as of december  an increase of yearoveryear • family daily active people dap was billion on average for december an increase of yearoveryear • family monthly active people map was billion as of december  an increase of yearoveryear financial results • revenue was billion up yearoveryear and advertising revenue was billion up yearoveryear • total costs and expenses were billion • income from operations was billion and operating margin was • net income was billion with diluted earnings per share of • capital expenditures including principal payments on finance leases were billion • effective tax rate was • cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were billion as of december  • headcount was as of december  an increase of yearoveryear our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together in response to the covid pandemic we have focused on helping people stay connected assisting the public health response and working on the economic recovery we have also continued to invest based on the following company priorities i continue making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our company including privacy safety and security ii build new experiences that meaningfully improve peoples lives today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future iii keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses that rely on our table of contents services to grow and create jobs and iv communicate more transparently about what were doing and the role our services play in the world in we also continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities i helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers where they are and ii making our ads more relevant and effective our business has been impacted by the covid pandemic which has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on business activity quarantines and shelterinplace orders these measures have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas both regionally and worldwide which have significantly impacted our business and results of operations beginning in the first quarter of we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of the covid pandemic more recently we have seen user growth and engagement returning to prepandemic trends particularly in the united states canada region we are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty and we expect these trends to continue to be subject to volatility the covid pandemic has also previously caused a reduction in the demand for advertising as well as a related decline in the pricing of our ads particularly in the second quarter of more recently we believe the pandemic has contributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce from offline to online as well as increasing consumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to services and we experienced increasing demand for advertising as a result of these trends however it is possible that this increased demand may not continue in future periods and may even recede as the effects of the pandemic subside which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement the demand for and pricing of our advertising services as well as on our overall results of operations remains highly uncertain for the foreseeable future in addition we expect that future advertising revenue growth will continue to be adversely affected by limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and thirdparty mobile operating systems and browsers we intend to continue to invest in our business based on our company priorities and we anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity servers network infrastructure and office facilities as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth will continue to drive expense growth in we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of billion and total expenses to be in the range of billion table of contents trends in our facebook user metrics the numbers for our key facebook metrics our daus maus and average revenue per user arpu do not include users on instagram whatsapp or our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as daus or maus respectively based on their other activities on facebook trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the value of our ads to marketers the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures substantially all of our daily and monthly active users as defined below access facebook on mobile devices • daily active users daus we define a daily active user as a registered and loggedin facebook user who visited facebook through our website or a mobile device or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user on a given day we view daus and daus as a percentage of maus as measures of user engagement on facebook daumau daumau   daumau daumau   daumau   note for purposes of reporting daus maus and arpu by geographic region europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa latin america and the middle east table of contents worldwide daus increased to billion on average during december from billion during december users in india the philippines and indonesia represented key sources of growth in daus during december relative to the same period in • monthly active users maus we define a monthly active user as a registered and loggedin facebook user who visited facebook through our website or a mobile device or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user in the last days as of the date of measurement maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community on facebook as of december we had  billion maus an increase of  from december users in india indonesia and the philippines represented key sources of growth in relative to the same period in  table of contents trends in our monetization by facebook user geography we calculate our revenue by facebook user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered virtual and digital goods are purchased or consumer hardware devices are shipped we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter while arpu includes all sources of revenue the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above the share of revenue from users who are not also facebook or messenger maus was not material the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets for example arpu in in the united states canada region was more than times higher than in the asiapacific region arpu  arpu   arpu  arpu   arpu   note our revenue by facebook user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our facebook users when they perform a revenuegenerating activity this allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the billing address of the customer table of contents our annual worldwide arpu in which represents the sum of quarterly arpu during such period was an increase of from over this period arpu increased by in the united states canada in europe and in asia‑pacific and arpu was flat in rest of world in addition user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu such as asia‑pacific and rest of world we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region table of contents trends in our family metrics the numbers for our key family metrics our dap map and average revenue per person arpp do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as map or dap respectively based on their other activities on our family products trends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the value of our ads to marketers the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures substantially all of our daily and monthly active people as defined below access our family products on mobile devices • daily active people dap we define a daily active person as a registered and loggedin user of facebook instagram messenger andor whatsapp collectively our family of products who visited at least one of these family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day we do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our family and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people our calculations of dap rely upon complex techniques algorithms and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person and counting such group of accounts as one person as these techniques and models require significant judgment are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and are calibrated against user survey data there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates we view dap and dap as a percentage of map as measures of engagement across our products for additional information see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form k dapmap   note we report the numbers of dap and map as specific amounts but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors while we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately of our worldwide map at our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates potentially beyond our estimated error margins for additional information see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form k in the second quarter of we updated our family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from a periodic whatsapp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements and we estimate such updates

consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is material we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs net in revenue recognition valuation of equity investments income taxes loss contingencies valuation of longlived assets including goodwill and intangible assets and their associated estimated useful lives have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note —summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k in response to the economic slowdown caused by the covid pandemic we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with collectibility assessment of revenue and credit losses of accounts receivable could have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements in future periods depending on the duration or degree of the impact of the covid pandemic on the global economy collectibility assessment of revenue under topic we recognize revenue using a fivestep model in step one for a revenue contract to exist it must be probable that substantially all of the consideration to which we are entitled to will be collected in performing such collectibility assessment we consider various facts and circumstances including future expectations about our customers ability and intention to pay collectibility assessment uses a probable threshold which requires estimation based on several objective and subjective factors such as probability of default customer’s intention to pay payment history financial strength geography and industry sub vertical risks the collectibility assessment has become uncertain during the current economic environment caused by the covid pandemic and our actual experience in the future may differ from our past experiences or current assessment credit losses of accounts receivable on january  we adopted accounting standards update no financial instrumentscredit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost that an entity does not expect to collect over the assets contractual life considering past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions for accounts receivable measured at amortized cost we use aging analysis probability of default methods and incorporate macroeconomic variables that are most relevant to evaluating and estimating the expected credit losses these macroeconomic variables may vary by geography customertype or industry sub vertical the contractual life of our trade accounts receivable is generally shortterm however we may experience increasing credit loss risks from accounts receivable in future periods depending on the duration or degree of economic slowdown caused by the covid pandemic and our actual experience in the future may differ from our past experiences or current assessment gross vs net in revenue recognition for revenue generated from arrangements that involve thirdparty publishers there is significant judgment in evaluating whether we are the principal and report revenue on a gross basis or the agent and report revenue on a net basis in this assessment we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment inventory risk and discretion in table of contents establishing price the assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenue recognized on the consolidated statements of income valuation of equity investments for our equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative determining whether an equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the equity security we hold may require judgment in a assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights distribution rights and preferences and conversion features and b adjustments to the observable price for differences such as but not limited to rights and obligations control premium liquidity or principal or most advantageous markets in addition the identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies which may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place therefore our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred for equity investments we perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment the qualitative assessment considers factors such as but not limited to the investees financial condition and business outlook industry and sector performance regulatory economic or technological environment operational and financing cash flows and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee when indicators of impairment exist we estimate the fair value of our equity investments using the market approach andor the income approach and recognize impairment loss in the consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates forecast cash flows holding period and market data of comparable companies among others income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position these uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate armslength prices similarly our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions including net interest and penalties we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different we make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results loss contingencies we are involved in legal proceedings claims and regulatory tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages additionally we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world the requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action with respect to these matters asserted and unasserted we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material we review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed we make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel table of contents and updated information significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters the ultimate outcome of these matters such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of managements estimates of losses our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable could be materially adversely affected see note —commitments and contingencies and note —income taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data and part i item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding these contingencies valuation of longlived assets including goodwill intangible assets and estimated useful lives we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to estimated replacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users acquired technology acquired patents and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense as acquired finitelived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets including goodwill are not amortized during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value as of december  no impairment of goodwill has been identified longlived assets including property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented the useful lives of our longlived assets including property and equipment and finitelived intangible assets are determined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives the current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate based on current facts and circumstances but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations changes in the planned use of assets and technological advancements when we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life historically changes in useful lives have not resulted in material changes to our depreciation and amortization expense table of contents components of results of operations revenue advertising we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook instagram messenger and thirdparty affiliated websites or mobile applications marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions such as clicks taken by users we recognize revenue from the display of impressionbased ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user we recognize revenue from the delivery of actionbased ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal we recognize revenue on a net basis

the number of ads delivered increased by as compared with approximately in the increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products and an increase in users in the average price per ad decreased by as compared with a decrease of approximately in the decrease in average price per ad during the year ended december  was primarily driven by a decrease in advertising demand globally during the first two quarters of due to the covid pandemic and to a lesser extent by an increasing proportion of the number of ads delivered as stories ads and in geographies that monetize at lower rates in the nearterm we anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be determined primarily by several factors the extent to which we continue to see increasing advertising demand in connection with the shift of commerce from offline to online as well as increased consumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to services as a result of the covid pandemic the status of the economic recovery from the slowdown caused by the covid pandemic and the magnitude of fiscal stimulus and the extent to which changes to the regulatory environment and thirdparty mobile operating systems and browsers result in limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year we believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters for instance our advertising revenue increased  and between the third and fourth quarters of  and respectively while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of and declined and compared to the fourth quarters of and respectively no customer represented or more of total revenue during the years ended december  and foreign exchange impact on revenue the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year  compared to the same period in  had an

effects of a tax election to capitalize and amortize certain research and development expenses for us income tax purposes in the third quarter of  as part of finalizing our us income tax return we elected to capitalize and amortize certain research and development expenses for us income tax purposes as a result we recorded a total of billion table of contents income tax benefit for the year ended december  the income tax benefit resulted from recording a deferred income tax asset that was greater than the current income tax liability due to different tax rates applicable for the periods in which capitalized expenses will be amortized versus the period in which the increased current tax liability was accrued we do not believe this election will materially affect our effective tax rate trend in the future on july  the united states tax court issued a decision tax court decision in altera corp v commissioner which concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to sharebased compensation the tax court decision was appealed by the commissioner to the ninth circuit court of appeals ninth circuit on june  the ninth circuit issued an opinion altera ninth circuit opinion that reversed the tax court decision based on the altera ninth circuit opinion we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of billion in the second quarter of on july  the taxpayer requested a rehearing before the full ninth circuit and the request was denied on november  the taxpayer requested a hearing before the supreme court of the united states and the request was denied on june  since we started to accrue income tax for sharebased compensation costsharing expense in the second quarter of the denial of the request by the supreme court did not have a material impact to our financial results in effective tax rate items our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision for income taxes us tax benefits from foreign derived intangible income tax effects from sharebased compensation tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions settlement of tax contingency items tax effects of changes in our business and the effects of changes in tax law the accounting for sharebased compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our sharebased compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting if our stock price remains constant to the january  price we expect our effective tax rate for the full year of will be in the highteens integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes consequently our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration the magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type size and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods unrecognized tax benefits as of december  we had net unrecognized tax benefits of billion which were accrued as other liabilities these unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries which includes licensing of intellectual property providing services and other transactions as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits the ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits litigation or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions we do not anticipate a material change to such amounts within the next months in july we received a statutory notice of deficiency notice from the irs related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the tax year while the notice applies only to the tax year the irs stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to we do not agree with the position of the irs and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the notice on january  the irs filed its pretrial memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the notice the first sessions of the trial began in february and additional sessions are expected to continue in the irs did not provide any information about how it intends to apply the revised adjustment to future years based on the information provided we believe that if the irs prevails in its updated position this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated aggregate amount of up to approximately billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed us return plus interest and any penalties asserted in march we received a second notice from the irs in conjunction with the examination of our through tax years the irs applied its position from the tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed if the irs prevails in its position for these new adjustments this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately million table of contents in excess of the amounts in our originally filed us returns plus interest and any penalties asserted we do not agree with the positions of the irs in the second notice and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the second notice we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc income taxes that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the irs in the two notices and its pretrial memorandum in addition if the irs prevails in its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the tax cuts and jobs act tax act as of december  we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the tax court we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with asc income taxes for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations the timing of the resolution settlement and closure of any audits is highly uncertain and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next months given the number of years remaining that are subject to examination in various jurisdictions we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits if the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due the assessed tax interest and penalties if any could have a material adverse effect on our financial

prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased our other liabilities also include billion related to net uncertain tax positions as of december  due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond

possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent

currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded at this time we have not entered

investment grade corporate debt securities our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements changes in us interest rates affect the

changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity equity investment risk our equity investments are subject to a wide variety of marketrelated risks that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our holdings we continually evaluate our equity investments in privatelyheld companies our equity investments are investments in equity securities of privatelyheld companies without readily determinable market values we elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement alternative which is cost less any impairment adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer we perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment the qualitative assessment considers factors such as but not limited to the investees financial condition and business outlook industry and sector performance economic or technological environment and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee valuations of our equity investments are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable transactions volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets including recent and ongoing effects related to the impact of the covid pandemic which requires significant

statements are free of material misstatement whether due to error or fraud our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks such procedures included examining on a test basis evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the

loss or range of possible loss that may be incurred however for certain other matters the company discloses that the amount of such losses or a range of possible losses cannot be reasonably estimated

evaluate managements assessments of the likelihood of a loss and their estimate of the potential amount or range of such losses how we addressed the matter in our audit we obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification and evaluation of these matters including controls relating to the companys assessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realized and their ability to reasonably estimate the potential range of possible losses to test the companys assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss whether the loss was reasonably estimable and the conclusion and disclosure regarding any range of possible losses including when the company believes it cannot be reasonably estimated at this time we read the minutes or a summary of the meetings of the committees of the board of directors read the proceedings claims and regulatory or government inquiries and investigations or summaries as we deemed appropriate

could result in an additional federal tax liability plus interest and any penalties asserted the company uses judgment to determine whether a tax positions technical merits are morelikelythannot to be sustained and measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition auditing the companys accounting for and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions was especially challenging due to the significant judgment required to assess managements evaluation of technical merits and the measurement of the tax position based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings how we addressed the matter in our audit we obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the companys process to assess the technical merits of tax positions related to these transfer pricing agreements and to measure the benefit of those tax positions as part of our audit procedures over the companys accounting for these positions we involved our tax professionals to assist with our assessment of the technical merits of the companys tax positions this included assessing the companys correspondence with the relevant tax authorities evaluating income tax opinions or other thirdparty advice obtained by the company and requesting and receiving confirmation letters from thirdparty advisors we also used our knowledge of and experience with the application of international and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate the companys accounting for those tax positions we analyzed the companys assumptions and data

community and bring the world closer together we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising basis of presentation we prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of facebook inc its subsidiaries where we have controlling financial interests and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation none of these reclassifications had a material impact to our consolidated financial statements use of estimates preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources we base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition valuation of equity investments income taxes loss contingencies valuation of longlived assets including goodwill and intangible assets and their associated estimated useful lives collectibility of accounts receivable credit losses of availableforsale afs debt securities fair value of financial instruments and leases these estimates are based on managements knowledge about current events and expectations about actions we may undertake in the future actual results could differ materially from those estimates the covid pandemic has created and may continue to create significant uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions which may cause further business slowdowns or shutdowns depress demand for our advertising business and adversely impact our results of operations during the year ended december  we faced uncertainties around our estimates of revenue collectibility and accounts receivable credit losses we expect uncertainties around our key accounting estimates to continue to evolve depending on the duration and degree of impact associated with the covid pandemic our estimates may change as new events occur and additional information emerges and such changes are recognized or disclosed in our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services we determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps • identification of the contract or contracts with a customer • identification of the performance obligations in the contract • determination of the transaction price • allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and • recognition of revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation revenue excludes sales and usage‑based taxes where it has been determined that we are acting as a pass‑through agent table of contents advertising advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook instagram messenger and thirdparty affiliated websites or mobile applications marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions such as clicks taken by our users we recognize revenue from the display of impressionbased ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users we recognize revenue from the delivery of actionbased ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for in general we report advertising revenue on a gross basis since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers for revenue generated from arrangements that involve thirdparty publishers we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent and for those advertising revenue arrangements where we are the agent we recognize revenue on a net basis we may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and certain customers may receive cash based incentives credits or refunds which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize we estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenue we believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration other revenue other revenue consists of revenue from the delivery of facebook reality labs frl consumer hardware devices net fees we receive from developers using our payments infrastructure as well as revenue from various other sources deferred revenue and deposits deferred revenue mostly consists of billings and payments we receive from marketers in advance of revenue recognition as well as revenue not yet recognized for unspecified software upgrades and updates for various frl products deposits relate to unused balances held on behalf of our users who primarily use these balances to make purchases in games on our platform once this balance is utilized by a user the majority of this amount would then be payable to the developer and the balance would be recognized as revenue the increase in the deferred revenue balance for the year ended december  was driven by cash payments from customers in advance of satisfying our performance obligations in frl sales and advertising revenue offset by revenue recognized that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period our payment terms vary by the products or services offered the term between billings and when payment is due is not significant for certain products or services and customer types we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer practical expedients and exemptions we generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less these costs are recorded within marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for i contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and ii contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure such as facility and server equipment depreciation salaries benefits and sharebased compensation for employees on our operations teams and energy and bandwidth costs cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements including traffic acquisition table of contents and content costs credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions and cost of consumer hardware devices sold content costs our content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform for licensed video we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met video content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date for licensed music we expense the license fees over the contractual license period expensed content costs are included in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of income software development costs software development costs including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed or sold to external users are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services these software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position these uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate armslength prices similarly our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions including net interest and penalties we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different we make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results table of contents advertising expense advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on the consolidated statements of income we incurred advertising expenses of billion billion and billion for the years ended december  and respectively cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of days or less from the date of purchase we hold investments in marketable securities consisting of us government securities us government agency securities and investment grade corporate debt securities we classify our marketable securities as availableforsale afs investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for current operations our afs investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses net of taxes included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity afs debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of that difference if any is caused by expected credit losses allowance for credit losses on afs debt securities are recognized as a charge in interest and other income expense net on our consolidated statements of income and any remaining unrealized losses net of taxes are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity the amount of credit losses recorded for the year ended december  was not material there was no impairment charge for any unrealized losses in and we determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method and record such gains or losses as interest and other income expense net on the consolidated statements of income we also maintain a multicurrency notional cash pool for our participating entities with a thirdparty bank provider actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities we classify the overdraft balances within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets we classify certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets based upon the term of the remaining restrictions equity investments our equity investments are investments in equity securities of privatelyheld companies without readily determinable market values we elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement alternative which is cost less any impairment adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer the change in carrying value if any is recognized in interest and other income expense net on our consolidated statements of income we periodically review our equity investments for impairment if indicators exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below the carrying amount we will write down the investment to fair value in addition we also held equity investments accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial as of december  and equity investments had a carrying value of billion and million as of december  and respectively there was no material impairment in  and fair value of financial instruments we apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis we define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the marketbased risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability such as risks inherent in valuation techniques transfer restrictions and credit risk fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities table of contents level observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability our valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of cash equivalents and marketable debt securities were derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs accounts receivable and allowances accounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts we make estimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit losses and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors including historical experience the age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality of our customers current economic conditions reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers expected credit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income as of december and  our accounts receivable net were billion and billion respectively and the allowances of accounts receivable were immaterial property and equipment property and equipment which includes amounts recorded under finance leases are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term whichever is shorter the estimated useful lives of property and equipment are described below property and equipment useful life network equipment three to years buildings three to years computer software office equipment and other two to five years finance lease rightofuse assets three to years leasehold improvements lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term  the useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives our current estimate of useful lives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations changes in the planned use of assets and technological advancements when we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life historically changes in useful lives have not resulted in material changes to our depreciation and amortization expense land and assets held within construction in progress are not depreciated construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use the cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations table of contents lease obligations we have operating leases comprised of certain offices data center land colocations and equipment leases we also have finance leases for certain network equipment we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception most of our leases contain lease and nonlease components nonlease components include fixed payments for maintenance utilities real estate taxes and management fees we combine fixed lease and nonlease components and account for them as a single lease component our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations common area maintenance insurance real estate taxes or other costs such variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of income for certain colocation and equipment leases we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease rightofuse rou assets and lease liabilities for leases that have greater than month lease term rou assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at commencement date based on the present value of remaining fixed lease payments we consider only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options when determining the probability of exercising such options we consider contractbased assetbased entitybased and marketbased factors as most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments our incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a similar economic environment operating leases are included in operating lease rou assets operating lease

liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets results and disclosure requirements for reporting periods beginning after january  are presented under topic while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under topic loss contingencies we are involved in legal proceedings claims and regulatory tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages additionally we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world the requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action with respect to these matters asserted and unasserted we evaluate the developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material we review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that has been previously recorded and the matters and related possible losses disclosed we make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters business combinations we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to estimated replacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users table of contents acquired technology acquired patents and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects company amortization expense as acquired finitelived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets including goodwill are not amortized during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings longlived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangibles assets we evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and acquired finitelived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value as of december  no impairment of goodwill has been identified acquired finitelived intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of property and equipment and finitelived intangible assets if we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance is amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life foreign currency generally the

consider restricted stock awards to be participating securities because holders of such shares have nonforfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for common shares undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in determining net income attributable to common stockholders basic eps is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weightedaverage number of shares of our class a and class b common stock outstanding adjusted for outstanding shares that are subject to repurchase for the calculation of diluted eps net income attributable to common stockholders for basic eps is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities including awards under our equity compensation plans in the calculation of diluted eps also included the effect of inducement awards under separate nonplan restricted stock unit rsu award agreements table of contents in addition the computation of the diluted eps of class a common stock assumes the conversion of our class b common stock to class a common stock while the diluted eps of class b common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares to

the parties agreed to a settlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit on november  the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement the settlement is subject to final court approval we believe the remaining lawsuits are without merit and we are vigorously defending them in addition the events surrounding this cyberattack became the subject of irish data protection commission idpc and other government inquiries from time to time we also notify the idpc our designated european privacy regulator under the general data protection regulation of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues and are subject to inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance although we are vigorously defending our regulatory compliance we believe there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate potential loss related to the inquiries and investigations by the idpc could be material in the aggregate in addition from time to time we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies including in particular in brazil and europe in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies including our obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances a number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties against us we believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties table of contents with respect to the cases actions and inquiries described above we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in addition we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these matters with respect to the matters described above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible loss such losses or range of possible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material but we believe there is a reasonable possibility that they may be material in the aggregate we are also party to various other legal proceedings claims and regulatory tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business for example from time to time we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations formal or informal by competition authorities in the united states europe and other jurisdictions such investigations inquiries and lawsuits concern among other things our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services digital advertising andor mobile or online applications as well as past acquisitions for example in june we were informed by the ftc that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company on december  the ftc filed a complaint against us in the us district court for the district of columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of section of the federal trade commission act and section of the sherman act by acquiring instagram in and whatsapp in and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform in addition beginning in the third quarter of we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the us department of justice and state attorneys general on december  the attorneys general from states the territory of guam and the district of columbia filed a complaint against us in the us district court for the district of columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of section of the sherman act by acquiring instagram in and whatsapp in and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform the complaint also alleges that we violated section of the clayton act by acquiring instagram and whatsapp the lawsuits of the ftc and attorneys general both seek a permanent injunction against our companys alleged violations of the antitrust laws and other equitable relief including divestiture or reconstruction of instagram and whatsapp multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the united states against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive conduct and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we are vigorously defending them additionally we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world the requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action with respect to these other legal proceedings claims regulatory tax or government inquiries and investigations and other matters asserted and unasserted we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in addition we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these other matters we believe that the amount of losses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these other matters will not either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements the ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of managements estimates of loss our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable could be materially adversely affected for information regarding income tax contingencies see note —income taxes table of contents indemnifications in the normal course of business to facilitate transactions of services and products we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters we have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers directors and certain employees and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in our opinion as of december  there was not at least a reasonable possibility we had incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of such parties we have not recorded any liability for costs related to indemnification through december  note stockholders equity common stock our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance

for  billion as of december  billion remained available and authorized for repurchases in january  an additional  billion of repurchases was authorized under this program the timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors including price general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under rule b under the securities exchange act of as

before their utilization the events that may cause ownership changes include but are not limited to a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than over a three‑year period the following table

altera corp v commissioner which concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to sharebased compensation the tax court decision was appealed by the commissioner to the ninth circuit court of appeals ninth circuit on june  the ninth circuit issued an opinion altera ninth circuit opinion that reversed the tax court decision based on the altera ninth circuit opinion we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of billion in the second quarter of on july  the taxpayer requested a rehearing before the full ninth circuit and the request was denied on november  the taxpayer requested a hearing before the supreme court of the united states and the request was denied on june  since we started to accrue income tax for sharebased compensation costsharing expense in the second quarter of the denial of the request by the supreme court did not have a material impact to our financial results in we are subject to taxation in the united states and various other state and foreign jurisdictions the material jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the united states and ireland we are under examination by the internal revenue service irs for our through and tax years and by the irish tax authorities for our through tax years our and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by the irs our and subsequent tax years remain open to examination in ireland in july we received a statutory notice of deficiency notice from the irs related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the tax year while the notice applies only to the tax year the irs stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to we do not agree with the position of the irs and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the notice on january  the irs filed its pretrial memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the notice the first session of the trial began in february and a second session is expected to continue in it is not clear how the irs intends to apply the revised adjustment to future years based on the information provided we believe that if the irs prevails in its updated position this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated aggregate amount of up to approximately  billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed us return plus interest and any penalties asserted in march we received a second notice from the irs in conjunction with the examination of our through tax years the irs applied its position from the tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed if the irs prevails in its position for these new adjustments this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately  million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed us returns plus interest and any penalties asserted we do not agree with the positions of the irs in the second notice and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the second notice we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc income taxes that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the irs in the two notices and its pretrial memorandum in addition if the irs prevails in its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the tax cuts and jobs act tax act as of december  we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the tax court we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with asc for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations the timing of the resolution settlement and closure of any audits is highly uncertain and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next months given the number of years remaining that are subject to examination we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized table of contents tax benefits if the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due the assessed tax interest and penalties if any could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows note

company we u and our in this document refer to facebook inc a delaware corporation and where appropriate it subsidiary the term facebook may also refer to our product regardless of the manner in which they are accessed the term family refers to our facebook instagram messenger and whatsapp product for reference to accessing facebook or our other product on the web or via a website such term refer to accessing such product on personal computer for reference to accessing facebook or our other product on mobile such term refers to accessing such product via a mobile application or via a mobileoptimized version of our website such a mfacebookcom whether on a mobile phone or tablet table of content limitation of key metric and other data the number for our key metric are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user account we have historically reported the number of our daily active user daus monthly active user maus and average revenue per user arpu collectively our facebook metric based on user activity only on facebook and messenger and not on our other product beginning with our annual report on form k for the year ended december we also report our estimate of the number of our daily active people dap monthly active people map and average revenue per person arpp collectively our family metric based on the activity of user who visited at least one of facebook instagram messenger and whatsapp collectively our family of product during the applicable period of measurement we believe our family metric better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one of our product a a result over time we intend to report our family metric a key metric in place of daus maus and arpu in our periodic report filed with the security and exchange commission while these number are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimate of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenge in measuring usage of our product across large online and mobile population around the world the methodology used to measure these metric require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical error in addition we are continually seeking to improve our estimate of our user base and such estimate may change due to improvement or change in our methodology we regularly review our process for calculating these metric and from time to time we discover inaccuracy in our metric or make adjustment to improve their accuracy which can result in adjustment to our historical metric our ability to recalculate our historical metric may be impacted by data limitation or other factor that require u to apply different methodology for such adjustment we generally do not intend to update previously disclosed family metric for any such inaccuracy or adjustment that are within the error margin disclosed below in addition our facebook metric and family metric estimate will differ from estimate published by third party due to difference in methodology facebook metric we regularly evaluate our facebook metric to estimate the number of duplicate and false account among our maus a duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account we divide false account into two category usermisclassified account where user have created personal profile for a business organization or nonhuman entity such a a pet such entity are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our term of service and violating account which represent user profile that we believe are intended to be used for purpose that violate our term of service such a bot and spam the estimate of duplicate and false account are based on an internal review of a limited sample of account and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example to identify duplicate account we use data signal such a identical ip address and similar user name and to identify false account we look for name that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewer any loss of access to data signal we use in this process whether a a result of our own product decision action by thirdparty browser or mobile platform regulatory or legislative requirement limitation while our personnel work remotely during the covid pandemic or other factor also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimate of duplicate and false account our estimate also may change a our methodology evolve including through the application of new data signal or technology or product change that may allow u to identify previously undetected duplicate or false account and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our user duplicate and false account are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false account may vary significantly from our estimate in the fourth quarter of we estimated that duplicate account may have represented approximately of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of duplicate account is meaningfully higher in developing market such a the philippine and vietnam a compared to more developed market in the fourth quarter of we estimated that false account may have represented approximately of our worldwide maus our estimation of false account can vary a a result of episodic spike in the creation of such account which we have seen originate more frequently in specific country such a indonesia and vietnam from time to time we disable certain user account make product change or take other action to reduce the number of duplicate or false account among our user which may also reduce our dau and mau estimate in a particular period we intend to disclose our estimate of the number of duplicate and false account among our maus on an annual basis table of content the number of daus and maus discussed in this annual report on form k a well a arpu do not include user on instagram whatsapp or our other product unless they would otherwise qualify a daus or maus respectively based on their other activity on facebook family metric many people in our community have user account on more than one of our product and some people have multiple user account within an individual product accordingly for our family metric we do not seek to count the total number of user account across our product because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community rather our family metric represent our estimate of the number of unique people using at least one of facebook instagram messenger and whatsapp we do not require people to use a common identifier or link their account to use multiple product in our family and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user account within and across product to individual people to calculate these metric we rely upon complex technique algorithm and machine learning model that seek to count the individual people behind user account including by matching multiple user account within an individual product and across multiple product when we believe they are attributable to a single person and counting such group of account a one person these technique and model require significant judgment are subject to data and other limitation discussed below and inherently are subject to statistical variance and uncertainty we estimate the potential error in our family metric primarily based on user survey data which itself is subject to error a well while we expect the error margin for our family metric to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately of our worldwide map at our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user account within and across product to individual people and it is possible that the actual number of unique people using our product may vary significantly from our estimate potentially beyond our estimated error margin a a result it is also possible that our family metric may indicate change or trend in user number that do not match actual change or trend to calculate our estimate of family dap and map we currently use a series of machine learning model that are developed based on internal review of limited sample of user account and calibrated against user survey data we apply significant judgment in designing these model and calculating these estimate for example to match user account within individual product and across multiple product we use data signal such a similar device information ip address and user name we also calibrate our model against data from periodic user survey of varying size and frequency across our product which are inherently subject to error the timing and result of such user survey have in the past contributed and may in the future contribute to change in our reported family metric from period to period in addition our data limitation may affect our understanding of certain detail of our business and increase the risk of error for our family metric estimate our technique and model rely on a variety of data signal from different product and we rely on more limited data signal for some product compared to others for example a a result of limited visibility into encrypted product we have fewer data signal from whatsapp user account and primarily rely on phone number and device information to match whatsapp user account with account on our other product similarly although messenger kid user are included in our family metric we do not seek to match their account with account on our other application for purpose of calculating dap and map any loss of access to data signal we use in our process for calculating family metric whether a a result of our own product decision action by third party browser or mobile platform regulatory or legislative requirement limitation while our personnel work remotely during the covid pandemic or other factor also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported family metric our estimate of family metric also may change a our methodology evolve including through the application of new data signal or technology product change or other improvement in our user survey algorithm or machine learning that may improve our ability to match account within and across our product or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our user in addition such evolution may allow u to identify previously undetected violating account a defined below we regularly evaluate our family metric to estimate the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating account we define violating account a account which we believe are intended to be used for purpose that violate our term of service including bot and spam in the fourth quarter of we estimated that approximately of our worldwide map consisted solely of violating account such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of account and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example we look for account information and behavior associated with facebook and instagram account that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewer but we have limited visibility into whatsapp user activity due to encryption in addition if we believe an individual person ha one or more violating account we do not include such person in our violating account estimation a long a we believe they have one account that doe not constitute a violating account from time to time we disable certain user account make product change or take other action to reduce the number of violating account among our user which may also reduce our dap and map estimate in a particular period we intend to disclose our estimate of the percentage of our map consisting solely table of content of violating account on an annual basis violating account are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of violating account may vary significantly from our estimate the number of family dap and map discussed in this annual report on form k a well a arpp do not include user on our other product unless they would otherwise qualify a dap or map respectively based on their other activity on our family product user geography our data regarding the geographic location of our user is estimated based on a number of factor such a the user ip address and selfdisclosed location these factor may not always accurately reflect the user actual location for example a user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user actual location the methodology used to measure our metric are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical error and our estimate for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factor table of content part i item business overview our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together we build useful and engaging

protect our proprietary right from time to time we have purchased patent and patent application from third party we do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or group of related patent or copyright we believe the duration of our patent is adequate relative to the expected life of our product government regulation we are subject to a variety of law and regulation in the united state and abroad that involve matter central to our business many of which are still evolving and being tested in court and could be interpreted in way that could harm our business these law and regulation involve matter including privacy data use data protection and personal information right of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion data localization and storage data disclosure artificial intelligence electronic contract and other communication competition protection of minor consumer protection telecommunication product liability ecommerce taxation economic or other trade prohibition or sanction anticorruption and political law compliance security law compliance and online payment service in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign law regarding privacy and protection of people data foreign data protection privacy content competition and other law and regulation can impose different obligation or be more restrictive than those in the united state these u federal and state and foreign law and regulation which in some case can be enforced by private party in addition to government entity are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change a a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these law and regulation are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policy and practice for example regulatory or legislative action affecting the manner in which we display content to our user or obtain consent to various practice or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our product could adversely affect our financial result in the united state there have been and continue to be various effort to remove or restrict the scope of the protection available to online platform under section of the communication decency act and any such change may increase our cost or require significant change to our product business practice or operation which could adversely affect our business and financial result table of content we are also subject to evolving law and regulation that dictate whether how and under what circumstance we can transfer process andor receive certain data that is critical to our operation including data shared between country or region in which we operate and data shared among our product and service if we are unable to transfer data between and among country and region in which we operate or if we are restricted from sharing data among our product and service it could affect our ability to provide our service the manner in which we provide our service or our ability to target ad which could adversely affect our financial result for example the privacy shield a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the european union to the united state wa invalidated in july by the court of justice of the european union cjeu in addition the other base upon which facebook relies to transfer such data such a standard contractual clause sccs have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny in august we received a preliminary draft decision from the irish data protection commission idpc that preliminarily concluded that facebook ireland reliance on sccs in respect of european user data doe not achieve compliance with the gdpr and preliminarily proposed that such transfer of user data from the european union to the united state should therefore be suspended facebook ireland challenged procedural aspect of this idpc inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the irish high court in september while we also rely upon alternative legal base for data transfer if a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on sccs or validly rely upon other alternative mean of data transfer from europe to the united state we may be unable to operate material portion of our business in europe a a result of the cjeus invalidation of the privacy shield and any final decision of idpc which would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation proposed or new legislation and regulation could also significantly affect our business for example the european general data protection regulation gdpr took effect in may and applies to all of our product and service used by people in europe the gdpr includes operational requirement for company that receive or process personal data of resident of the european union that are different from those previously in place in the european union and includes significant penalty for noncompliance the brazilian general data protection law recently took effect and imposes data privacyrelated requirement similar to gdpr on product and service offered

our revenue financial result and business may be significantly harmed the size of our user base and our user level of engagement are critical to our success our financial performance ha been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active user of our product particularly for facebook and instagram we anticipate that our active user growth rate will generally decline over time a the size of our active user base increase and we expect that the size of our active user base will fluctuate or decline in one or more market from time to time particularly in market where we have achieved higher penetration rate for example beginning in the first quarter of we experienced significant increase in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of region a a result of the covid pandemic more recently we have seen user growth and engagement returning to prepandemic trend and in each of the third and fourth quarter of we experienced slight decline on a quarteroverquarter basis in the number of daily active user on facebook in the united state canada region we are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty and we expect these trend to continue to be subject to volatility if people do not perceive our product to be useful reliable and trustworthy we may not be able to attract or retain user or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement a number of other social networking company that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user base or level of engagement decline in some case precipitously there is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement level our user engagement pattern have changed over time and user engagement can be difficult to measure particularly a we introduce new and different product and service any number of factor can negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if • user increasingly engage with other competitive product or service • we fail to introduce new feature product or service that user find engaging or if we introduce new product or service or make change to existing product and service that are not favorably received • user feel that their experience is diminished a a result of the decision we make with respect to the frequency prominence format size and quality of ad that we display • user have difficulty installing updating or otherwise accessing our product on mobile device a

our product by making it easier for our user to interact and share on thirdparty mobile and web application from time to time certain of these factor have negatively affected user retention growth and engagement to varying degree if we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement particularly for our significant revenuegenerating product like facebook and instagram our revenue and financial result may be adversely affected any significant decrease in user retention growth or engagement could render our product le attractive to user marketer and developer which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our revenue business financial condition and result of operation if our active user growth rate continues to slow we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase level of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising the loss of marketer or reduction in spending by marketer could seriously harm our business substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third party advertising on facebook and instagram a is common in the industry our marketer do not have longterm advertising commitment with u many of our marketer spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with u marketer will not continue to do business with u or they will reduce the budget they are willing to commit to u if we do not deliver ad in an effective manner or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with u will generate a competitive return relative to other alternative we have implemented and we will continue to implement change to our user data practice some of these change reduce our ability to effectively target ad which ha to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business if we are unable to provide marketer with a suitable return on investment the pricing of our ad may not increase or may decline in which case our revenue and financial result may be harmed our advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factor including • decrease in user engagement including time spent on our product • our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our product • product change or inventory management decision we may make that change the size format frequency or relative prominence of ad displayed on our product or of other unpaid content shared by marketer on our

accuracy utility and security of analytics and measurement solution offered by u or third party that demonstrate the value of our ad to marketer or our ability to further improve such tool • loss of advertising market share to our competitor including if price to purchase our ad increase or if competitor offer lower priced more integrated or otherwise more effective product • limitation on our ability to operate material portion of our business in europe a a result of european regulator court or legislative body determining that our reliance on sccs or other legal base we rely upon to transfer user data from the european union to the united state is invalid • change in our marketing and sale or other operation that we are required to or elect to make a a result of risk related to complying with foreign law or regulatory requirement or other government action • decision by marketer to reduce their advertising a a result of adverse medium report or other negative publicity involving u our user data practice our advertising metric or tool content on our product our effort to implement or enforce policy relating to content on our product including a a result of decision or recommendation from the independent oversight board developer with mobile and web application that are integrated with our product or other company in our industry • reduction of advertising by marketer due to objectionable content made available on our product by third party question about our user data practice concern about brand safety or potential legal liability or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligation for example a number of marketer announced that they paused advertising with u in july due to concern about content on our product • the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which user opt out of the use of data for ad including a a result of product change and control that we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with the gdpr eprivacy directive california consumer privacy act ccpa other law regulation or regulatory action or otherwise that impact our ability to use data for advertising purpose • the degree to which user cease or reduce the number of time they engage with our ad • change in the way advertising on mobile device or on personal computer is measured or priced • the success of technology designed to block the display of ad or ad measurement tool • change in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base and • the impact of macroeconomic condition whether in the advertising industry in general or among specific type of marketer or within particular geography from time to time certain of these factor have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degree the occurrence of any of these or other factor in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ad which may reduce the price we receive for our ad or cause marketer to stop advertising with u altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial result for example macroeconomic condition have affected and may in the future affect marketer ability or willingness to spend with u a we have seen with the regional and worldwide economic disruption related to the covid pandemic and associated decline in advertising activity on our product the effect of the pandemic previously resulted in reduced demand for our ad a related decline in pricing of our ad and additional demand on our technical infrastructure a a result of increased usage of our service and any similar occurrence in the future may impair our ability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ad shown to user and adversely affect our revenue and financial result table of content our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tool that incorporate data signal from user activity on website and service that we do not control and change to the regulatory environment thirdparty mobile operating system and browser and our own product have impacted and we expect will continue to impact the availability of such signal which will adversely affect our advertising revenue we rely on data signal from user activity on website and service that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ad to our user our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tool that incorporate these signal and any change in our ability to use such signal will adversely affect our business for example legislative and regulatory development such a the gdpr eprivacy directive and ccpa have impacted and we expect will continue to impact our ability to use such signal in our ad product in particular we have seen an increasing number of user opt out of certain type of ad targeting in europe following adoption of the gdpr and we have introduced product change that limit data signal use for certain user in california following adoption of the ccpa regulatory guidance or decision or new legislation may require u to make additional change to our product in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signal in addition mobile operating system and browser provider such a apple and google have announced product change a well a future plan to limit the ability of application developer to collect and use these signal to target and measure advertising for example in june apple announced that it plan to make certain change to it product and data use policy in connection with the release of it io operating system that will reduce our and other io developer ability to target and measure advertising which we expect will in turn reduce the budget marketer are willing to commit to u and other advertising platform in addition we have implemented and may continue to implement product change that give user the ability to limit our use of such data signal to improve ad and other experience on our product and service including our offfacebook activity tool and our worldwide offering of certain product change we implemented in connection with the gdpr these development have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ad on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising revenue and if we are unable to mitigate these development a they take further effect in the future our targeting and measurement capability will be materially and adversely affected which would in turn significantly impact our future advertising revenue growth our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile device depend upon effective operation with mobile operating system network technology product and standard that we do not control the substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile device there is no guarantee that popular mobile device will continue to feature facebook or our other product or that mobile device user will continue to use our product rather than competing product we are dependent on the interoperability of facebook and our other product with popular mobile operating system network technology product and standard that we do not control such a the android and io operating system and mobile browser any change bug or technical issue in such system or change in our relationship with mobile operating system partner handset manufacturer browser developer or mobile carrier or in their term of service or policy that degrade our product functionality reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our product give preferential treatment to competitive product limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ad or charge fee related to the distribution of our product or our delivery of ad could adversely affect the usage of facebook or our other product and monetization on mobile device for example apple previously released an update to it safari browser that limit the use of thirdparty cooky which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ad to our user and impact monetization and more recently announced change to io that will limit our ability to target and measure ad effectively we expect that any similar change to it google or other browser or mobile platform will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ad and impact monetization additionally in order to deliver high quality mobile product it is important that our product work well with a range of mobile technology product system network and standard that we do not control and that we have good relationship with handset manufacturer mobile carrier and browser developer we may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationship with key participant in the mobile ecosystem or in developing product that operate effectively with these technology product system network or standard in the event that it is more difficult for our user to access and use facebook or our other product on their mobile device or if our user choose not to access or use facebook or our other product on their mobile device or use mobile product that do not offer access to facebook or our other product our user growth and user engagement could be harmed from time to time we may also take action regarding the distribution of our product or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our longterm best interest such action may adversely affect our user and our relationship with the operator of mobile operating system handset manufacturer mobile carrier browser developer other business partner or advertiser and there is no assurance that these action will result in the anticipated longterm benefit in the event that our user are adversely affected by these action or if our relationship with such third party deteriorate our user growth engagement and monetization could be adversely affected table of content and our business could be harmed we have in the past experienced challenge in operating with mobile operating system network technology product and standard that we do not control and any such occurrence in the future may negatively impact our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile device which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial result our new product and change to existing product could fail to attract or retain user or generate revenue and profit our ability to retain increase and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing product and to create successful new product both independently and in conjunction with developer or other third party we may introduce significant change to our existing product or acquire or introduce new and unproven product including using technology with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience for example we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware product or virtual or augmented reality technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these product and technology we continue to incur substantial cost and we may not be successful in generating profit in connection with these effort in addition the introduction of new product or change to existing product may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny litigation or other complication that could adversely affect our business and financial result we have also invested and expect to continue to invest significant resource in growing our whatsapp and messenger product to support increasing usage of such product we have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion and we may not be successful in our effort to generate meaningful revenue or profit from messaging over the long term in addition we are moving forward with plan to implement endtoend encryption across our messaging service a well a facilitate crossapp communication between these platform which plan have drawn governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdiction if our new or enhanced product fail to engage user marketer or developer or if our business plan are unsuccessful we may fail to attract or retain user or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or other value to justify our investment and our business may be adversely affected we make product and investment decision that may not prioritize shortterm financial result and may not produce the longterm benefit that we expect we frequently make product and investment decision that may not prioritize shortterm financial result if we believe that the decision are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term for example we have implemented and we will continue to implement change to our user data practice some of these change reduce our ability to effectively target ad which ha to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business for example our offfacebook activity tool enables user to place limit on our storage and use of information about their interaction with advertiser apps and website which reduces our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective ad to our user similarly from time to time we update our news feed ranking algorithm to optimize the user experience and these change have had and may in the future have the effect of reducing time spent and some measure of user engagement with facebook which could adversely affect our financial result from time to time we may also change the size frequency or relative prominence of ad in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience in addition we have made and we expect to continue to make other change to our product which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publisher marketer and developer and could reduce their incentive to invest in their effort on facebook or our other product we also may introduce new feature or other change to existing product or introduce new standalone product that attract user away from property format or use case where we have more proven mean of monetization for example we previously introduced the story format which we do not currently monetize at the same rate a news feed in addition a we focus on growing user and engagement across our family of product from time to time these effort have reduced and may in the future reduce engagement with one or more product and service in favor of other product or service that we monetize le successfully or that are not growing a quickly these decision may adversely affect our business and result of operation and may not produce the longterm benefit that we expect if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand our ability to expand our base of user marketer and developer may be impaired and our business and financial result may be harmed we believe that our brand have significantly contributed to the success of our business we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to expanding our base of user marketer and developer many of our new user are referred by existing user maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative product which we may not do successfully we may introduce new table of content product or term of service or policy that user do not like which may negatively affect our brand additionally the action of our developer or advertiser may affect our brand if user do not have a positive experience using thirdparty mobile and web application integrated with our product or interacting with party that advertise through our product we will also continue to experience medium legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our action or decision regarding user privacy data use encryption content advertising competition and other issue including action or decision in connection with election or the covid‑ pandemic which ha in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our reputation and brand for example in march we announced development regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third party in violation of our term and policy we also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our service or objectionable practice by advertiser or developer or to otherwise address user concern which ha occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in our brand our brand may also be negatively affected by the action of user that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other user by the action of user acting under false or inauthentic identity by the use of our product or service to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading or intended to manipulate opinion by perceived or actual effort by government to obtain access to user information for securityrelated purpose or to censor certain content on our platform by the use of our product or service for illicit or objectionable end including for example any such action around the pandemic or election in the united state and around the world by decision or recommendation regarding content on our platform from the independent oversight board or by our decision to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by person who violate our community standard or term of service maintaining and enhancing our brand will require u to make substantial investment and these investment may not be successful certain of our past action such a the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concern around our handling of political speech and advertising hate speech and other content have eroded confidence in our brand and if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or if we incur excessive expense in this effort our business and financial result may be adversely affected we may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web application that integrate with facebook and our other product we have made and are continuing to make investment to enable developer to build grow and monetize mobile and web application that integrate with facebook and our other product such existing and prospective developer may not be successful in building growing or monetizing mobile andor web application that create and maintain user engagement additionally developer may choose to build on other platform including mobile platform controlled by third party rather than building product that integrate with facebook and our other product we are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objective of our developer with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developer for example from time to time we have taken action to reduce the volume of communication from these developer to user on facebook and our other product with the objective of enhancing the user experience and such action have reduced distribution from user engagement with and our monetization opportunity from mobile and web application integrated with our product in addition a part of our effort related to privacy safety and security we conduct investigation and audit of platform application from time to time and we also have announced several product change that restrict developer access to certain user data in some instance these action a well a other action to enforce our policy applicable to developer have adversely affected or will adversely affect our relationship with developer if we are not successful in our effort to maintain or grow the number of developer that choose to build product that integrate with facebook and our other product or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relation with such developer our user growth and user engagement and our financial result may be adversely affected risk related to our business operation and financial result the covid pandemic ha had and may in the future have a significant adverse impact on our advertising revenue and also expose our business to other risk the covid pandemic ha resulted in authority implementing numerous preventative measure to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus such a travel ban and restriction limitation on business activity quarantine and shelterinplace order these measure have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdown or shutdown in affected area both regionally and worldwide which have significantly impacted our business and result of operation for example in the second quarter of our advertising revenue grew yearoveryear which wa the slowest growth rate for any fiscal quarter since our initial public offering while our advertising revenue growth rate improved in subsequent table of content quarter there can be no assurance that it will not decrease again a a result of the effect of the pandemic in addition we believe that the pandemic ha contributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce from offline to online a well a increasing consumer demand for purchasing product a opposed to service which in turn have increased demand for our advertising service however it is possible that this increased demand may not continue in future period and may even recede a the effect of the pandemic subside which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth the demand for and pricing of our advertising service may be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the foreseeable future and we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such impact with any certainty in addition to the impact on our advertising business the pandemic expose our business operation and workforce to a variety of other risk including • volatility in the size of our user base and user engagement particularly for our messaging product whether a a result of shelterinplace measure or other factor • decreased user engagement a a result of user inability to purchase data pack or device to access our product and service • interruption in the accessibility or performance of our product and service due to capacity constraint from increased usage or product change we implement to maintain accessibility of our service such a reducing the quality of video to reduce bandwidth usage • delay in product development or release or reduction in manufacturing production and sale of consumer hardware a a result of inventory shortage supply chain or labor shortage or diversion of our effort and resource to project related to covid • increased misuse of our product and service or user data by third party including improper advertising practice or other activity inconsistent with our term contract or policy misinformation or other illicit or objectionable material on our platform election interference or other undesirable activity • adverse impact to our effort to combat misuse of our product and service and user data a a result of limitation on our safety security and content review effort while our workforce is working remotely such a the necessity to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence to perform task that our workforce is unable to perform • our inability to recognize revenue collect payment or generate future revenue from marketer including from those that have been or may be forced to close their business or are otherwise impacted by the economic downturn • increased expense resulting from our initiative or donation related to the pandemic • significant volatility and disruption of global financial market which could cause fluctuation in currency exchange rate or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future • negative impact on our workforce productivity product development and research and development due to difficulty resulting from our personnel working remotely • illness to key employee or a significant portion of our workforce which may result in inefficiency delay and disruption in our business and • increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projection we use a the basis for estimate used in our financial statement any of these development may adversely affect our business harm our reputation or result in legal or regulatory action against u the persistence of covid and the preventative measure implemented to help limit the spread of the illness have impacted and will continue to impact our ability to operate our business and may materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and result of operation our business is highly competitive competition present an ongoing threat to the success of our business we compete with company providing connection and communication product and service to user online a well a company that sell advertising to business looking to reach consumer andor develop tool and system for managing table of content and optimizing advertising campaign we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including but not limited to company that facilitate the ability of user to share communicate and discover content and information online or enable marketer to reach their existing or prospective audience including for example google apple youtube tencent snap twitter bytedance microsoft and amazon we compete to attract engage and retain people who use our product to attract and retain business that use our free or paid business and advertising service and to attract and retain developer who build compelling mobile and web application that integrate with our product we also compete with company that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual reality product and service a we introduce or acquire new product a our existing product evolve or a other company introduce new product and service we may become subject to additional competition some of our current and potential competitor may have greater resource or stronger competitive position in certain product segment geographic region or user demographic than we do for example some of our competitor may be domiciled in different country and subject to political legal and regulatory regime that enable them to compete more effectively than u these factor may allow our competitor to respond more effectively than u to new or emerging technology and change in market condition we believe that some user particularly younger user are aware of and actively engaging with other product and service similar to or a a substitute for our product and service and we believe that some user have reduced their use of and engagement with our product and service in favor of these other product and service in the event that user increasingly engage with other product and service we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographic or more broadly in which case our business would likely be harmed our competitor may develop product feature or service that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more farreaching and successful product development effort or marketing campaign or may adopt more aggressive pricing policy some competitor may gain a competitive advantage against u in area where we operate including by making acquisition by limiting our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ad by imposing fee or other charge related to our delivery of ad by making access to our product more difficult or impossible by making it more difficult to communicate with our user or by integrating competing platform application or feature into product they control such a mobile device operating system search engine browser or ecommerce platform for example each of apple and google have integrated competitive product with io and android respectively in addition apple ha announced change to io that will limit our ability and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry to target and measure ad effectively a a result our competitor may and in some case will acquire and engage user or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own effort which would negatively affect our business and financial result in addition from time to time we may take action in response to competitive threat but we can not assure you that these action will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial result we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factor both within and beyond our control including • the popularity usefulness ease of use performance and reliability of our product compared to our competitor product • the size and composition of our user base • the engagement of user with our product and competing product • our ability to attract and retain business who use our free or paid business and advertising service • the timing and market acceptance of product including development and enhancement to our or our competitor product • our safety and security effort and our ability to protect user data and to provide user with control over their data • our ability to distribute our product to new and existing user • our ability to monetize our product table of content • the frequency size format quality and relative prominence of the ad displayed by u or our competitor • customer service and support effort • marketing and selling effort including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ad and to provide marketer with a compelling return on their investment • our ability to establish and maintain developer interest in building mobile and web application that integrate with facebook and our other product • our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with facebook and our other product • change mandated by legislation regulatory authority or litigation some of which may have a disproportionate effect on u • acquisition or consolidation within our industry which may result in more formidable competitor • our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employee particularly software engineer designer and product manager • our ability to costeffectively manage and grow our operation and • our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitor if we are not able to compete effectively our user base and level of user engagement may decrease we may become le attractive to developer and marketer and our revenue and result of operation may be materially and adversely affected unfavorable medium coverage negatively affect our business from time to time we receive a high degree of medium coverage around the world unfavorable publicity regarding for example our privacy practice term of service advertising policy product change product quality litigation or regulatory activity government surveillance the action of our advertiser the action of our developer whose product are integrated with our product the use of our product or service for illicit or objectionable end the substance or enforcement of our community standard the action of our user the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform or the action of other company that provide similar service to ours ha in the past and could in the future adversely affect our reputation for example we have been the subject of significant medium coverage involving concern around our handling of political speech and advertising hate speech and other content and we continue to receive negative publicity related to these topic in addition we have been and may in the future be subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit or objectionable use of our product or service including in connection with the covid pandemic and election in the united state and around the world any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our product which could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial result and we have experienced such adverse effect to varying degree from time to time our financial result will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict our quarterly financial result have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future additionally we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business which make it difficult to forecast our future result a a result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial result a indicator of future performance you should take into account the risk and uncertainty frequently encountered by company in rapidly evolving market our financial result in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factor many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including • our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement table of content • our ability to attract and retain marketer in a particular period • our ability to recognize revenue or collect payment from marketer in a particular period including a a result of the effect of the covid pandemic • fluctuation in spending by our marketer due to seasonality such a historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year episodic regional or global event including the covid pandemic or other factor • the frequency prominence size format and quality of ad shown to user • the success of technology designed to block the display of ad • change to thirdparty policy that limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of advertising including change by mobile operating system and browser provider such a apple and google • the pricing of our ad and other product • the diversification and growth of revenue source beyond advertising on facebook and instagram • our ability to generate revenue from payment or the sale of our consumer hardware product or other product we may introduce in the future • change to existing product or service or the development and introduction of new product or service by u or our competitor • user behavior or product change that may reduce traffic to feature or product that we successfully monetize • increase in marketing sale and other operating expense that we will incur to grow and expand our operation and to remain competitive including cost related to our data center and technical infrastructure • cost related to our privacy safety security and content review effort including a a result of implementing change to our practice whether voluntarily in connection with law regulation regulatory action or decision or recommendation from the independent oversight board or otherwise • cost and expense related to the development and delivery of our consumer hardware product • our ability to maintain gross margin and operating margin • cost related to acquisition including cost associated with amortization and additional investment to develop the acquired technology • charge associated with impairment of any asset on our balance sheet • our ability to obtain equipment component and labor for our data center and other technical infrastructure in a timely and costeffective manner • system failure or outage or government blocking which could prevent u from serving ad for any period of time • breach of security or privacy and the cost associated with any such breach and remediation • change in the manner in which we distribute our product or inaccessibility of our product due to thirdparty action • fee paid to third party for content or the distribution of our product table of content • refund or other concession provided to advertiser • sharebased compensation expense including acquisitionrelated expense • adverse litigation judgment settlement or other litigationrelated cost • change in the legislative or regulatory environment including with respect to privacy and data protection or action by government or regulator including fine order or consent decree • the overall tax rate for our business which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the u and in jurisdiction with different tax rate the effect of sharebased compensation the effect of integrating intellectual property from acquisition the effect of change in our business or structure and the effect of discrete item such a legal and tax settlement and tax election • the impact of change in tax law or judicial or regulatory interpretation of tax law which are recorded in the period such law are enacted or interpretation are issued and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period • tax obligation that may arise from resolution of tax examination including the examination we are currently under by the internal revenue service irs that materially differ from the amount we have anticipated • fluctuation in currency exchange rate and change in the proportion of our revenue and expense denominated in foreign currency • trading activity in our share repurchase program • fluctuation in the market value of our investment in marketable security in the valuation of our equity investment and in interest rate • change in u generally accepted accounting principle and • change in regional or global business or macroeconomic condition including a a result of the covid pandemic which may impact the other factor described above we expect our rate of growth to be volatile in the near term a a result of the covid pandemic and to decline over time in the future we expect our user and revenue growth rate to be volatile in the near term a a result of the covid pandemic although we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such volatility with any certainty in the long term we expect that our user growth rate will generally decline over time a the size of our active user base increase and the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more market particularly a we achieve greater market penetration we also expect our revenue growth rate will continue to decline over time a our revenue increase to higher level a our growth rate experience volatility or decline investor perception of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our class a common stock could decline our cost are continuing to grow and some of our investment particularly our investment in virtual and augmented reality have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability if our investment are not successful longerterm our business and financial performance will be harmed operating our business is costly and we expect our expense to continue to increase in the future a we broaden our user base a user increase the amount and type of content they consume and the data they share with u for example with respect to video a we develop and implement new product a we market new and existing product and promote our brand a we continue to expand our technical infrastructure a we continue to invest in new and unproven technology and a we continue to hire additional employee and contractor to support our expanding operation including our effort to focus on privacy safety security and content review in addition from time to time we are subject to settlement judgment table of content fine or other monetary penalty in connection with legal and regulatory development that may be material to our business we are also continuing to increase our investment in new platform and technology some of these investment particularly our significant investment in virtual and augmented reality have generated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability and we expect the adverse financial impact of such investment to continue for the foreseeable future if our investment are not successful longerterm our business and financial performance will be harmed we plan to continue to make acquisition and pursue other strategic transaction which could harm our financial condition or result of operation and may adversely affect the price of our common stock a part of our business strategy we have made and intend to continue to make acquisition to add specialized employee and complementary company product or technology and from time to time may enter into other strategic transaction such a investment and joint venture we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidate and we may not be able to complete acquisition or other strategic transaction on favorable term if at all including a a result of regulatory challenge in some case the cost of such acquisition or other strategic transaction may be substantial and there is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on investment for our acquisition or other strategic transaction we may pay substantial amount of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisition or other strategic transaction which ha occurred in the past and could adversely affect our liquidity the incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligation and increased interest expense and could also include covenant or other restriction that would impede our ability to manage our operation we may also issue equity security to pay for acquisition and we regularly grant rsus to retain the employee of acquired company which could increase our expense adversely affect our financial result and result in dilution to our stockholder in addition any acquisition or other strategic transaction we announce could be viewed negatively by user marketer developer or investor which may adversely affect our business or the price of our class a common stock we may also discover liability deficiency or other claim associated with the company or asset we acquire that were not identified in advance which may result in significant unanticipated cost the effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the result of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statement and disclosure made or action taken by the company we acquire or their representative a well a the limited amount of time in which acquisition are executed in addition we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other strategic transaction including tax and accounting charge acquisition or other strategic transaction may also result in our recording of significant additional expense to our result of operation and recording of substantial finitelived intangible asset on our balance sheet upon closing any of these factor may adversely affect our financial condition or result of operation we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisition and we incur significant cost to integrate and support the company we acquire the integration of acquisition requires significant time and resource and we may not manage these process successfully our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisition is unproven particularly with respect to company that have significant operation or that develop product where we do not have prior experience we continue to make substantial investment of resource to support our acquisition which will result in significant ongoing operating expense and may divert resource and management attention from other area of our business we can not assure you that these investment will be successful if we fail to successfully integrate the company we acquire we may not realize the benefit expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service including a a result of the covid pandemic could damage our reputation result in a potential loss of user and engagement and adversely affect our financial result our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our user is dependent upon the reliable performance of our product and our underlying technical infrastructure we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience interruption in the availability or performance of our product from time to time our system may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delay or outage that could be harmful to our business if our product are unavailable when user attempt to access them or if they do not load a quickly a expected user may not use our product a often in the future or at all and our ability to serve ad may be table of content disrupted any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance a the amount and type of information shared on facebook and our other product continue to grow and evolve a the usage pattern of our global community continue to evolve and a our internal operational demand continue to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy our need it is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demand which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue growth in addition our business may be subject to interruption delay or failure resulting from earthquake adverse weather condition other natural disaster power loss terrorism geopolitical conflict other physical security threat cyberattacks or other catastrophic event if such an event were to occur user may be subject to service disruption or outage and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our service which may adversely affect our financial result for example the increase in the use of our product a a result of the covid pandemic increased demand on our technical infrastructure additional product development effort during this time have put additional pressure on our technical infrastructure we may not be able to accommodate these demand including a a result of our reduced data center operation and personnel working remotely during the pandemic a substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third party any disruption or failure in the service we receive from these provider could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business any financial or other difficulty these provider face may adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these provider which increase our vulnerability to problem with the service they provide the effect of the covid pandemic have increased the risk of supply or labor shortage or other disruption in logistics or the supply chain for our technical infrastructure a a result we may not be able to procure sufficient equipment or service from third party to satisfy our need or we may be required to procure such service or equipment on unfavorable term any of these development may result in interruption in the availability or performance of our product require unfavorable change to existing product delay the introduction of future product or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial result we could experience unforeseen difficulty in building and operating key portion of our technical infrastructure we have designed and built our own data center and key portion of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our product and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data center subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable system and other project the infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves project in multiple location around the world including in emerging market that expose u to increased risk relating to anticorruption compliance and political challenge among others we have in the past suspended and may in the future suspend certain of these project a a result of the covid pandemic additional unanticipated delay or disruption in the completion of these project including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portion of such project or availability of component challenge in obtaining required government or regulatory approval or other geopolitical challenge or action by government whether a a result of the pandemic trade dispute or otherwise may lead to increased project cost operational inefficiency interruption in the delivery or degradation of the quality or reliability of our product or impairment of asset on our balance sheet in addition there may be issue related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phase of design and implementation which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that could further degrade the user experience or increase our cost further much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the united state and it is possible that action by a foreign government or our response to such government action could result in the impairment of a portion of our technical infrastructure which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the quality or reliability of our product and lead to a negative user experience or increase our cost any of these event could adversely affect our business reputation or financial result real or perceived inaccuracy in our community and other metric may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business the number for our key metric which include our facebook metric daus maus and average revenue per user arpu and family metric dap map and average revenue per person arpp are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user account while these number are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimate of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenge in measuring usage of our product across large online and mobile population around the world the methodology used to measure these metric require table of content significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical error in addition we are continually seeking to improve our estimate of our user base and such estimate may change due to improvement or change in our methodology we regularly review our process for calculating these metric and from time to time we discover inaccuracy in our metric or make adjustment to improve their accuracy which can result in adjustment to our historical metric our ability to recalculate our historical metric may be impacted by data limitation or other factor that require u to apply different methodology for such adjustment we generally do not intend to update previously disclosed family metric for any such inaccuracy or adjustment that are within the error margin disclosed below in addition our facebook metric and family metric estimate will differ from estimate published by third party due to difference in methodology we regularly evaluate our facebook metric to estimate the number of duplicate and false account among our maus a duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account we divide false account into two category usermisclassified account where user have created personal profile for a business organization or nonhuman entity such a a pet such entity are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our term of service and violating account which represent user profile that we believe are intended to be used for purpose that violate our term of service such a bot and spam the estimate of duplicate and false account are based on an internal review of a limited sample of account and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example to identify duplicate account we use data signal such a identical ip address and similar user name and to identify false account we look for name that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewer any loss of access to data signal we use in this process whether a a result of our own product decision action by thirdparty browser or mobile platform regulatory or legislative requirement limitation while our personnel work remotely during the covid pandemic or other factor also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimate of duplicate and false account our estimate also may change a our methodology evolve including through the application of new data signal or technology or product change that may allow u to identify previously undetected duplicate or false account and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our user duplicate and false account are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false account may vary significantly from our estimate in the fourth quarter of we estimated that duplicate account may have represented approximately of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of duplicate account is meaningfully higher in developing market such a the philippine and vietnam a compared to more developed market in the fourth quarter of we estimated that false account may have represented approximately of our worldwide maus our estimation of false account can vary a a result of episodic spike in the creation of such account which we have seen originate more frequently in specific country such a indonesia and vietnam from time to time we disable certain user account make product change or take other action to reduce the number of duplicate or false account among our user which may also reduce our dau and mau estimate in a particular period we intend to disclose our estimate of the number of duplicate and false account among our maus on an annual basis many people in our community have user account on more than one of our product and some people have multiple user account within an individual product accordingly for our family metric we do not seek to count the total number of user account across our product because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community rather our family metric represent our estimate of the number of unique people using at least one of facebook instagram messenger and whatsapp we do not require people to use a common identifier or link their account to use multiple product in our family and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user account within and across product to individual people to calculate these metric we rely upon complex technique algorithm and machine learning model that seek to count the individual people behind user account including by matching multiple user account within an individual product and across multiple product when we believe they are attributable to a single person and counting such group of account a one person these technique and model require significant judgment are subject to data and other limitation discussed below and inherently are subject to statistical variance and uncertainty we estimate the potential error in our family metric primarily based on user survey data which itself is subject to error a well while we expect the error margin for our family metric to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately of our worldwide map at our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user account within and across product to individual people and it is possible that the actual number of unique people using our product may vary significantly from our estimate potentially beyond our estimated error margin a a result it is also possible that our family metric may indicate change or trend in user number that do not match actual change or trend table of content to calculate our estimate of family dap and map we currently use a series of machine learning model that are developed based on internal review of limited sample of user account and calibrated against user survey data we apply significant judgment in designing these model and calculating these estimate for example to match user account within individual product and across multiple product we use data signal such a similar device information ip address and user name we also calibrate our model against data from periodic user survey of varying size and frequency across our product which are inherently subject to error the timing and result of such user survey have in the past contributed and may in the future contribute to change in our reported family metric from period to period in addition our data limitation may affect our understanding of certain detail of our business and increase the risk of error for our family metric estimate our technique and model rely on a variety of data signal from different product and we rely on more limited data signal for some product compared to others for example a a result of limited visibility into encrypted product we have fewer data signal from whatsapp user account and primarily rely on phone number and device information to match whatsapp user account with account on our other product similarly although messenger kid user are included in our family metric we do not seek to match their account with account on our other application for purpose of calculating dap and map any loss of access to data signal we use in our process for calculating family metric whether a a result of our own product decision action by third party browser or mobile platform regulatory or legislative requirement limitation while our personnel work remotely during the covid pandemic or other factor also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported family metric our estimate of family metric also may change a our methodology evolve including through the application of new data signal or technology product change or other improvement in our user survey algorithm or machine learning that may improve our ability to match account within and across our product or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our user in addition such evolution may allow u to identify previously undetected violating account a defined below we regularly evaluate our family metric to estimate the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating account we define violating account a account which we believe are intended to be used for purpose that violate our term of service including bot and spam in the fourth quarter of we estimated that approximately of our worldwide map consisted solely of violating account such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of account and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example we look for account information and behavior associated with facebook and instagram account that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewer but we have limited visibility into whatsapp user activity due to encryption in addition if we believe an individual person ha one or more violating account we do not include such person in our violating account estimation a long a we believe they have one account that doe not constitute a violating account from time to time we disable certain user account make product change or take other action to reduce the number of violating account among our user which may also reduce our dap and map estimate in a particular period we intend to disclose our estimate of the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating account on an annual basis violating account are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of violating account may vary significantly from our estimate other data limitation also may affect our understanding of certain detail of our business for example while userprovided data indicates a decline in usage among younger user this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger user register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our user is estimated based on a number of factor such a the user ip address and self disclosed location these factor may not always accurately reflect the user actual location for example a user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user actual location the methodology used to measure our metric are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical error and our estimate for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factor in addition from time to time we provide or rely on certain other metric and estimate including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ad many of our metric involve the use of estimation and judgment and our metric and estimate are subject to software bug inconsistency in our system and human error where marketer developer or investor do not perceive our metric or estimate to be accurate or where we discover material inaccuracy in our metric or estimate we may be subject to liability our reputation may be harmed and marketer and developer may be le willing to allocate their budget or resource to facebook or our other product which could negatively affect our business and financial result table of content we can not assure you that we will effectively manage our growth our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employee increasing to a of december from a of december and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future in addition we plan to continue to hire a number of employee and contractor to continue to bolster various privacy safety security and content review initiative a well a other function to support our expected growth the growth and expansion of our business and product create significant challenge for our management operational and financial resource including managing multiple relationship with user marketer developer and other third party a our operation and the number of our thirdparty relationship continue to grow our information technology system or our internal control and procedure may not be adequate to support such growth in addition some member of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively additionally the vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely a a result of the covid pandemic which limit their ability to perform certain job function and may negatively impact productivity in the long term we may experience such challenge to productivity and collaboration a some personnel transition to working remotely on a regular basis and we may experience difficulty integrating recently hired personnel when our office reopen to effectively manage our growth we must continue to adapt to a remote work environment improve our operational financial and management process and system and effectively expand train and manage our personnel a our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structure we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefit of our corporate culture including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative product this could negatively affect our business performance we have significant international operation and plan to continue expanding our operation abroad where we have more limited operating experience and this may subject u to increased business economic and legal risk that could affect our financial result we have significant international operation and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operation and the translation of our product we currently make facebook available in more than different language and we have office or data center in more than different country we may enter new international market where we have limited or no experience in marketing selling and deploying our product our product are generally available globally but some or all of our product or functionality may not be available in certain market due to legal and regulatory complexity for example facebook and certain of our other product are not generally available in china we also outsource certain operational function to thirdparty vendor globally if we fail to deploy manage or oversee our international operation successfully our business may suffer in addition we are subject to a variety of risk inherent in doing business internationally including • political social or economic instability • risk related to legal regulatory and other government scrutiny applicable to u company with sale and operation in foreign jurisdiction including with respect to privacy tax law enforcement content trade compliance competition consumer protection intellectual property and infrastructure matter • potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local law including potential censorship or requirement to provide user information to local authority • enhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standard across different language and country • fluctuation in currency exchange rate and compliance with currency control • foreign exchange control and tax and other regulation and order that might prevent u from repatriating cash earned in country outside the united state or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently • higher level of credit risk and payment fraud table of content • enhanced difficulty of integrating any foreign acquisition • burden of complying with a variety of foreign law including law related to taxation content removal data localization payment and regulatory oversight • reduced protection for intellectual property right in some country • difficulty in staffing managing and overseeing global operation and the increased travel infrastructure and legal compliance cost associated with multiple international location including difficulty arising from personnel working remotely during the covid pandemic • compliance with statutory equity requirement and management of tax consequence and • geopolitical event affecting u our marketer or our industry including trade dispute and pandemic in addition we must manage the potential conflict between locally accepted business practice in any given jurisdiction and our obligation to comply with law and regulation including anticorruption law or regulation applicable to u such a the u foreign corrupt practice act and the uk bribery act we also must manage our obligation to comply with law and regulation related to export control sanction and embargo including regulation established by the u office of foreign asset control government agency and authority have a broad range of civil and criminal penalty they may seek to impose against company for violation of anticorruption law or regulation export control and other law rule sanction embargo and regulation if we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operation successfully our financial result could be adversely affected we face design manufacturing and supply chain risk that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial result we face a number of risk related to design manufacturing and supply chain management with respect to our consumer hardware product for example the consumer hardware product we sell from time to time have had and in the future may have quality issue resulting from the design or manufacture of the product or from the software used in the product sometimes these issue may be caused by component we purchase from other manufacturer or supplier our brand and financial result could be adversely affected by any such quality issue other failure to meet our customer expectation or finding of our consumer hardware product to be defective we rely on third party to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware product which subject u to a number of risk that have been exacerbated a a result of the covid pandemic we may experience supply or labor shortage or other disruption in logistics or the supply chain that could result in shipping delay and negatively impact our operation product development and sale we could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third party with the necessary capability or capacity on reasonable term or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligation whether due to financial difficulty manufacturing constraint or other reason or make adverse change in the pricing or other material term of such arrangement with them the manufacturing distribution and sale of our consumer hardware product also may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic condition geopolitical challenge trade dispute or other action by government that subject u to supply shortage increased cost or supply chain disruption we also require the supplier and business partner of our consumer hardware product to comply with law and certain company policy regarding sourcing practice and standard on labor health and safety the environment and business ethic but we do not control them or their practice and standard if any of them violates law fails to implement change in accordance with newly enacted law or implement practice or standard regarded a unethical corrupt or noncompliant we could experience supply chain disruption government action or fine canceled order or damage to our reputation we face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware product we are exposed to inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware product a a result of rapid change in table of content product cycle and pricing unsafe or defective merchandise change in consumer demand and consumer spending pattern change in consumer taste with respect to our consumer hardware product and other factor the demand for our product can also change significantly between the time inventory or component are ordered and the date of sale while we endeavor to accurately predict these trend and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer hardware product we may sell from time to time we have experienced difficulty in accurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our product in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international market it may be difficult to establish vendor relationship determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain type of inventory or component may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable any one of the foregoing factor may adversely affect our operating result we are involved in numerous class action lawsuit and other litigation matter that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm our business financial condition or result of operation we are involved in numerous lawsuit including stockholder derivative lawsuit and putative class action lawsuit many of which claim statutory damage andor seek significant change to our business operation and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuit in the future because of the scale of our user advertiser and developer base the plaintiff in class action case filed against u typically claim enormous monetary damage even if the alleged peruser or entity harm is small or nonexistent in addition we have in the past and may in the future be subject to additional class action lawsuit based on claim related to advertising antitrust privacy content employment or product performance or other claim related to the use of consumer hardware and software a well a virtual reality technology and product which are new and unproven for example we are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suit in connection with our platform and user data practice and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third party in violation of our term and policy the disclosure of our earnings result for the second quarter of and our acquisition of instagram and whatsapp a well a other alleged anticompetitive conduct we also agreed to settle certain lawsuit in connection with the tag suggestion facial recognition feature on facebook and a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access token and access certain profile information from user account on facebook the result of any such lawsuit and claim can not be predicted with certainty and any negative outcome from any such lawsuit could result in payment of substantial monetary damage or fine or undesirable change to our product or business practice and accordingly our business financial condition or result of operation could be materially and adversely affected there can be no assurance that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our case and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employee any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payment of substantial monetary damage or fine or we may decide to settle lawsuit on similarly unfavorable term which ha occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business financial condition or result of operation we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liability our tax obligation including income and nonincome tax are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangement including the manner in which we operate our business develop value manage protect and use our intellectual property and the valuation of our intercompany transaction the tax law applicable to our business including the law of the united state and other jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdiction are aggressively interpreting their law in new way in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from company such a facebook we are subject to regular review and audit by u federal state and foreign tax authority tax authority may disagree with certain position we have taken including our methodology for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangement and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of nonincome tax imposed on our business and harm our financial position result of operation and cash flow for example in and the irs issued formal assessment relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiary in conjunction with the examination of the through tax year although we disagree with the irs position and are litigating this issue the ultimate resolution is uncertain and if resolved in a manner unfavorable to u may adversely affect our financial result the determination of our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability requires significant judgment by management and there are many transaction where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income tax is determined by the manner in which we operate our business and any change to such operation or law applicable to such operation may affect our effective tax rate although we believe that our provision for income tax and estimate of table of content our nonincome tax liability are reasonable the ultimate settlement may differ from the amount recorded in our financial statement and may materially affect our financial result in the period or period for which such determination is made our future income tax rate could be volatile and difficult to predict due to change in jurisdictional profit split change in the amount and recognition of deferred tax asset and liability or by change in tax law regulation or accounting principle change in tax law or tax ruling could materially affect our financial position result of operation and cash flow the tax regime we are subject to or operate under including income and nonincome tax are unsettled and may be subject to significant change change in tax law or tax ruling or change in interpretation of existing law could materially affect our financial position result of operation and cash flow for example the tax cut and job act tax act enacted in december had a significant impact on our tax obligation and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of the issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the tax act or other executive or congressional action in the united state could materially affect our tax obligation and effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such action take effect in addition many country in europe a well a a number of other country and organization have recently proposed or recommended change to existing tax law or have enacted new law that could significantly increase our tax obligation in many country where we do business or require u to change the manner in which we operate our business the organization for economic cooperation and development ha been working on a base erosion and profit shifting project and issued a report in an interim report in and blueprint in that if implemented would change various aspect of the existing framework under which our tax obligation are determined in many of the country in which we do business similarly the european commission and several country have issued proposal that would apply to various aspect of the current tax framework under which we are taxed these proposal include change to the existing framework to calculate income tax a well a proposal to change or impose new type of nonincome tax including tax based on a percentage of revenue for example several country have proposed or enacted tax applicable to digital service which includes business activity on social medium platform and online marketplace and which apply to our business the european commission ha conducted investigation in multiple country focusing on whether local country tax ruling or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rule and concluded that certain country including ireland have provided illegal state aid in certain case these investigation may result in change to the tax treatment of our foreign operation due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activity many of these type of change to the taxation of our activity described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of nonincome tax imposed on our business and harm our financial position result of operation and cash flow such change may also apply retroactively to our historical operation and result in tax greater than the amount estimated and recorded in our financial statement given our level of sharebased compensation our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price the tax effect of the accounting for sharebased compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period in period in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the sharebased compensation vesting in that period we will recognize excess tax benefit that will decrease our effective tax rate for example in excess tax benefit recognized from sharebased compensation decreased our provision for income tax by million and our effective tax rate by two percentage point a compared to the tax rate without such benefit in future period in which our stock price is lower than the grant price of the sharebased compensation vesting in that period our effective tax rate may increase the amount and value of sharebased compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of sharebased compensation on our effective tax rate these tax effect are dependent on our stock price which we do not control and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial result table of content if our goodwill or finitelived intangible asset become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings we review our finitelived intangible asset for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such a a decline in stock price and market capitalization we test goodwill for impairment at least annually if such goodwill or finitelived intangible asset are deemed to be impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset would be recognized we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statement during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finitelived intangible asset is determined which would negatively affect our result of operation the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business we currently depend on the continued service and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl k sandberg although we have entered into employment agreement with mr zuckerberg and m sandberg the agreement have no specific duration and constitute atwill employment in addition many of our key technology and system are custommade for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel including member of management a well a key engineering product development marketing and sale personnel could disrupt our operation and have an adverse effect on our business a we continue to grow we can not guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position in particular we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future and we expect to continue to face significant challenge in hiring such personnel particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located whether a a result of competition with other company challenge due to the high cost of living facility and infrastructure constraint or other factor a we continue to mature the incentive to attract retain and motivate employee provided by our equity award or by future arrangement may not be a effective a in the past and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employee or to retain our existing employee we would incur substantial additional sharebased compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholder would be further diluted our ability to attract retain and motivate employee may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility a a result of these factor it may be difficult for u to continue to retain and motivate our employee if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively our ceo ha control over key decision making a a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and ceo is able to exercise voting right with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore ha the ability to control the outcome of matter submitted to our stockholder for approval including the election of director and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our asset this concentrated control could delay defer or prevent a change of control merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our asset that our other stockholder support or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholder do not support this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our class a common stock which ha limited voting power relative to the class b common stock and might harm the trading price of our class a common stock in addition mr zuckerberg ha the ability to control the management and major strategic investment of our company a a result of his position a our ceo and his ability to control the election or in some case the replacement of our director in the event of his death the share of our capital stock that mr zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the person or entity that he ha designated a a board member and officer mr zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholder and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably belief to be in the best interest of our stockholder a a stockholder even a controlling stockholder mr zuckerberg is entitled to vote his share and share over which he ha voting control a governed by a voting agreement in his own interest which may not always be in the interest of our stockholder generally we can not guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value share repurchase could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserve table of content although our board of director ha authorized a share repurchase program that doe not have an expiration date the program doe not obligate u to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of share of our class a common stock we can not guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value the program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock in addition this program will diminish our cash reserve risk related to government regulation and enforcement action by government that restrict access to facebook or our other product in their country or that otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their country could substantially harm our business and financial result government from time to time seek to censor content available on facebook or our other product in their country restrict access to our product from their country entirely or impose other restriction that may affect the accessibility of our product in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely for example user access to facebook and certain of our other product ha been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in china iran and north korea in addition government authority in other country may seek to restrict user access to our product if they consider u to be in violation of their law or a threat to public safety or for other reason and certain of our product have been restricted by government in other country from time to time for example in june hong kong adopted a national security law that provides authority with the ability to obtain information remove and block access to content and suspend user service and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our product may be restricted in addition if we are required to or elect to make change to our marketing and sale or other operation in hong kong a a result of the national security law our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected it is also possible that government authority could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising including in country where access to our consumerfacing product may be blocked or restricted for example we generate meaningful revenue from a limited number of resellers representing advertiser based in china and it is possible that the chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our chinabased advertising revenue whether a a result of the trade dispute with the united state in response to content issue or information request in hong kong or elsewhere or for other reason or take other action against u such a imposing tax or other penalty which could adversely affect our financial result similarly if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirement for social medium company in turkey the turkish government could take action to reduce or eliminate our turkeybased advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our product in the event that content shown on facebook or our other product is subject to censorship access to our product is restricted in whole or in part in one or more country we are required to or elect to make change to our operation or other restriction are imposed on our product or our competitor are able to successfully penetrate new geographic market or capture a greater share of existing geographic market that we can not access or where we face other restriction our ability to retain or increase our user base user engagement or the level of advertising by marketer may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue a anticipated and our financial result could be adversely affected our business is subject to complex and evolving u and foreign law and regulation regarding privacy data use and data protection content competition consumer protection and other matter many of these law and regulation are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claim change to our business practice monetary penalty increased cost of operation or decline in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business we are subject to a variety of law and regulation in the united state and abroad that involve matter central to our business including privacy data use data protection and personal information right of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion data localization and storage data disclosure artificial intelligence electronic contract and other communication competition protection of minor consumer protection telecommunication product liability ecommerce taxation economic or other trade prohibition or sanction anticorruption and political law compliance security law compliance and online payment service the introduction of new product expansion of our activity in certain jurisdiction or other action that we may take may subject u to additional law regulation or other government scrutiny in addition foreign data protection privacy content competition and other law and regulation can impose different obligation or be more restrictive than those in the united state these u federal and state and foreign law and regulation which in some case can be enforced by private party in addition to government entity are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change a a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these law and regulation are often uncertain particularly in the new and table of content rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policy and practice for example regulatory or legislative action affecting the manner in which we display content to our user or obtain consent to various practice could adversely affect user growth and engagement such action could affect the manner in which we provide our service or adversely affect our financial result we are also subject to evolving law and regulation that dictate whether how and under what circumstance we can transfer process andor receive certain data that is critical to our operation including data shared between country or region in which we operate and data shared among our product and service for example in the european union and united state agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the european union to the united state called the privacy shield but the privacy shield wa invalidated in july by the court of justice of the european union cjeu in addition the other base upon which facebook relies to transfer such data such a standard contractual clause sccs have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny for example the cjeu considered the validity of sccs a a basis to transfer user data from the european union to the united state following a challenge brought by the irish data protection commission idpc although the cjeu upheld the validity of sccs in july our continued reliance on sccs is contingent on sccs being held to satisfy certain new condition that are yet to be clearly defined and will be the subject of future regulatory guidance and the european commission ha recently proposed new sccs which are currently subject to consultation in addition in august we received a preliminary draft decision from the idpc that preliminarily concluded that facebook ireland reliance on sccs in respect of european user data doe not achieve compliance with the gdpr and preliminarily proposed that such transfer of user data from the european union to the united state should therefore be suspended facebook ireland challenged procedural aspect of this idpc inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the irish high court in september and the court ordered the idpc not to take further step in respect of the inquiry until the judicial review proceeding conclude subject to the idpcs right to apply to vary or lift this order which we expect to occur in the coming month while we also rely upon alternative legal base for data transfer if a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on sccs or validly rely upon other alternative mean of data transfer from europe to the united state we may be unable to operate material portion of our business in europe a a result of the cjeus invalidation of the privacy shield and any final decision of idpc which would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation we have also been managing investigation and lawsuit in europe india and other jurisdiction regarding the august update to whatsapps term of service and privacy policy and it sharing of certain data with other facebook product and service including a lawsuit currently pending before the supreme court of india if we are unable to transfer data between and among country and region in which we operate or if we are restricted from sharing data among our product and service it could affect our ability to provide our service the manner in which we provide our service or our ability to target ad which could adversely affect our financial result proposed or new legislation and regulation could also significantly affect our business for example the european general data protection regulation gdpr took effect in may and applies to all of our product and service used by people in europe the gdpr includes operational requirement for company that receive or process personal data of resident of the european union that are different from those previously in place in the european union a a result we implemented measure to change our service for minor under the age of for certain country in europe that maintain the minimum age of under the gdpr we also obtain consent andor offer new control to existing and new user in europe before processing data for certain aspect of our service in addition the gdpr requires submission of personal data breach notification to our designated european privacy regulator the idpc and includes significant penalty for noncompliance with the notification obligation a well a other requirement of the regulation similarly the brazilian general data protection law recently took effect and imposes data privacyrelated requirement on product and service offered to user in brazil the california consumer privacy act ccpa which took effect in january also establishes certain transparency rule and creates new data privacy right for user including more ability to control how their data is shared with third party these law and regulation are evolving and subject to interpretation and resulting limitation on our advertising service or reduction of advertising by marketer have to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business for example regulator have recently issued new guidance concerning the eprivacy directive requirement regarding the use of cooky and similar technology in addition effective december the eprivacy directive includes additional limitation on the use of data across messaging product and includes significant penalty for noncompliance change to our product or business practice a a result of these development may adversely affect our advertising business similarly there are a number of legislative proposal in the european union the united state at both the federal and state level a well a other jurisdiction that could impose new obligation or limitation in area affecting our business in addition some country are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirement or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirement that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our service table of content these law and regulation a well a any associated claim inquiry or investigation or any other government action have in the past led to and may in the future lead to unfavorable outcome including increased compliance cost delay or impediment in the development of new product negative publicity and reputational harm increased operating cost diversion of management time and attention and remedy that harm our business including fine or demand or order that we modify or cease existing business practice we have been subject to regulatory and other government investigation enforcement action and settlement and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceeding and other inquiry in the future which could cause u to incur substantial cost or require u to change our business practice in a manner materially adverse to our business from time to time we receive formal and informal inquiry from government authority and regulator regarding our compliance with law and regulation many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigation inquiry data request request for information action and audit in the united state europe and around the world particularly in the area of privacy data protection law enforcement consumer protection and competition a we continue to grow and expand our operation in addition we are currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory order or consent decree for example data protection competition and consumer protection authority in the european union and other jurisdiction have initiated action investigation or administrative order seeking to restrict the way in which we collect and use information or impose sanction and other authority may do the same in addition beginning in march we became subject to ftc state attorney general and other government inquiry in the united state europe and other jurisdiction in connection with our platform and user data practice a well a the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third party in violation of our term and policy in july we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the ftc inquiry which wa approved by the federal court and took effect in april among other matter our settlement with the ftc required u to pay a penalty of billion and to significantly enhance our practice and process for privacy compliance and oversight beginning in september we also became subject to idpc and other government inquiry in connection with a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access token and access certain profile information from user account on facebook from time to time we also notify the idpc our designated european privacy regulator under the gdpr of certain other personal data breach and privacy issue and are subject to inquiry and investigation regarding various aspect of our regulatory compliance in addition from time to time we are subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiry and investigation by competition authority in the united state europe and other jurisdiction which relate to many aspect of our business including with respect to user and advertiser a well a our industry such inquiry investigation and lawsuit concern among other thing our business practice in the area of social networking or social medium service digital advertising andor mobile or online application a well a past acquisition for example in june we were informed by the ftc that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company in addition beginning in the third quarter of we became the subject of antitrust inquiry and investigation by the u department of justice the u house of representative and state attorney general in december the ftc and the attorney general from state the territory of guam and the district of columbia filed complaint against u in the u district court for the district of columbia alleging that we violated antitrust law by acquiring instagram in and whatsapp in and by maintaining condition on access to our platform among other thing the lawsuit of the ftc and attorney general both seek a permanent injunction against our company alleged violation of the antitrust law and other equitable relief including divestiture or reconstruction of instagram and whatsapp order issued by or inquiry or enforcement action initiated by government or regulatory authority could cause u to incur substantial cost expose u to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalty including substantial monetary remedy interrupt or require u to change our business practice in a manner materially adverse to our business result in negative publicity and reputational harm divert resource and the time and attention of management from our business or subject u to other structural or behavioral remedy that adversely affect our business and we have experienced some of these adverse effect to varying degree from time to time table of content compliance with our ftc consent order the gdpr the ccpa the eprivacy directive and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirement require significant operational resource and modification to our business practice and any compliance failure may have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and financial result we are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight effort including in connection with our modified consent order with the ftc requirement of the gdpr and other regulatory and legislative requirement around the world such a the ccpa and the eprivacy directive in particular we are implementing a comprehensive expansion of our privacy program in connection with the ftc consent order including substantial management and board of director oversight stringent operational requirement and reporting obligation prohibition against making misrepresentation relating to user data a process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the ftc and regular assessment of our privacy program by an independent thirdparty assessor which ha been and will continue to be challenging and costly to implement these compliance and oversight effort are increasing demand on our system and resource and require significant new and ongoing investment including investment in compliance process personnel and technical infrastructure we are reallocating resource internally to assist with these effort and this ha had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our other business initiative in addition these effort require substantial modification to our business practice and make some practice such a product and ad development more difficult timeconsuming and costly a a result we believe our ability to develop and launch new feature product and service in a timely manner ha been and will continue to be adversely affected we also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight effort will require significant time and attention from our management and board of director the requirement of the ftc consent order and other privacyrelated law and regulation are complex and apply broadly to our business and from time to time we notify relevant authority of instance where we are not in full compliance with these requirement or otherwise discover privacy issue and we expect to continue to do so a any such issue arise in the future in addition regulatory and legislative privacy requirement are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation if we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandate of the ftc consent order gdpr ccpa eprivacy directive or other regulatory or legislative requirement or if we are found to be in violation of the consent order or other applicable requirement we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigation or lawsuit which may result in significant monetary fine judgment or other penalty and we may also be required to make additional change to our business practice any of these event could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and financial result we may incur liability a a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our product or a a result of claim related to our product and legislation regulating content on our platform may require u to change our product or business practice and may adversely affect our business and financial result we have faced currently face and will continue to face claim relating to information or content that is published or made available on our product including our policy and enforcement action with respect to such information or content in particular the nature of our business expose u to claim related to defamation dissemination of misinformation or news hoax discrimination harassment intellectual property right right of publicity and privacy personal injury tort law regulating hate speech or other type of content and breach of contract among others this risk is enhanced in certain jurisdiction outside the united state where our protection from liability for thirdparty action may be unclear or where we may be le protected under local law than we are in the united state for example in april the european union passed a directive expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain us of news content online which member state are required to implement by june in addition the european union revised the european audiovisual medium service directive to apply to online videosharing platform which member state are expected to implement by in the united state there have been and continue to be various congressional and executive effort to remove or restrict the scope of the protection available to online platform under section of the communication decency act a well a to impose new obligation on online platform with respect to commerce listing counterfeit good and copyrightinfringing material and our current protection from liability for thirdparty content in the united state could decrease or change we could incur significant cost investigating and defending such claim and if we are found liable significant damage we could also face fine order restricting or blocking our service in particular geography or other governmentimposed remedy a a result of content hosted on our service for example legislation in germany ha in the past and may in the future result in the imposition of fine for failure to comply with certain content removal law enforcement cooperation and disclosure obligation numerous other country in europe asiapacific and latin america are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing penalty including fine service throttling or advertising ban for failure to remove certain type of content or follow certain process for example we have been subject to fine and may in the future be subject to other penalty in connection with social medium legislation in turkey in addition australia recently announced proposed legislation that would among other matter require u to pay publisher for certain table of content news content that is shared on facebook and instagram contentrelated legislation also ha required u in the past and may require u in the future to change our product or business practice increase our compliance cost or otherwise impact our operation or our ability to provide service in certain geography for example the european copyright directive requires certain online service to obtain authorization for copyrighted content or to implement measure to prevent the availability of that content which may require u to make substantial investment in compliance process in addition change to section of the communication decency act may increase our cost or require significant change to our product business practice or operation which could adversely affect user growth and engagement any of the foregoing event could adversely affect our business and financial result payment transaction may subject u to additional regulatory requirement and other risk that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business our user can purchase virtual and digital good from developer that offer application using our payment infrastructure on the facebook website in addition certain of our user can use our payment infrastructure including on messenger and whatsapp for other activity such a sending money to other user and making donation to certain charitable organization we are subject to a variety of law and regulation in the united state europe and elsewhere including those governing antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing money transmission gift card and other prepaid access instrument electronic fund transfer charitable fundraising and import and export restriction depending on how our payment product evolves we may also be subject to other law and regulation including those governing gambling banking and lending in some jurisdiction the application or interpretation of these law and regulation is not clear to increase flexibility in how our use of payment may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter license in the united state and an electronic money emoney license that allows u to conduct certain regulated payment activity in the participating member country of the european economic area which will generally require u to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign law in these area our effort to comply with these law and regulation could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance in the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirement we may be subject to monetary fine or other penalty such a a cease and desist order or we may be required to make product change any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial result in addition we are subject to a variety of additional risk a a result of payment transaction including increased cost and diversion of management time and effort and other resource to deal with bad transaction or customer dispute potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by user developer employee or third party restriction on the investment of consumer fund used to transact payment and additional disclosure and reporting requirement we have also launched certain payment functionality on whatsapp and have announced plan to develop digital payment product and service which may subject u to many of the foregoing risk and additional licensing requirement our participation in the diem association subject u to significant regulatory scrutiny and other risk that could adversely affect our business reputation or financial result in june we announced our participation in the diem association which will oversee a proposed digital payment system powered by blockchain technology and our plan for novi a digital wallet for diem which we expect to launch a a standalone application and subsequently in messenger and whatsapp diem is based on relatively new and unproven technology and the law and regulation surrounding blockchainbased payment are uncertain and evolving diem ha drawn significant scrutiny from government and regulator in multiple jurisdiction and we expect that scrutiny to continue a a sponsor of the initiative and a proposed digital wallet service provider we are participating in response to inquiry from government and regulator and adverse government or regulatory action or negative publicity resulting from such participation may adversely affect our reputation and harm our business a this initiative evolves both diem and novi may be subject to a variety of law and regulation in the united state and international jurisdiction including those governing payment financial service antimoney laundering counterterrorism financing economic sanction data protection tax and competition in many jurisdiction the application or interpretation of these law and regulation is not clear particularly with respect to evolving law and regulation that are applied to blockchain and digital payment to mitigate regulatory uncertainty diem ha applied for a payment system operator license with the swiss financial market supervisory authority finma and novi ha applied for money table of content transmitter license in the united state and certain other country and other financial service license in certain other country that would allow u to conduct digital wallet activity in these country using the diem network these license law and regulation a well a any associated inquiry or investigation may delay or impede the launch of the diem digital payment system a well a the development of our product and service increase our operating cost require significant management time and attention or otherwise harm our business in addition market acceptance of such a digital payment system is subject to significant uncertainty a such there can be no assurance that diem or our associated product and service will be made available in a timely manner or at all we do not have significant prior experience with blockchainbased payment technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these product and service we will also incur increased cost in connection with our participation in the diem association and the development and marketing of associated product and service and our investment may not be successful any of these event could adversely affect our business reputation or financial result risk related to data security and intellectual property security breach improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data other hacking and phishing attack on our system or other cyber incident could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business our industry is prone to cyberattacks by third party seeking unauthorized access to our data or user data or to disrupt our ability to provide service our product and service involve the collection storage processing and transmission of a large amount of data any failure to prevent or mitigate security breach and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data including personal information content or payment information from user or information from marketer could result in the loss modification disclosure destruction or other misuse of such data which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position in addition computer malware virus social engineering predominantly spear phishing attack scraping and general hacking have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our system in the past and will occur on our system in the future we also regularly encounter attempt to create false or undesirable user account purchase ad or take other action on our platform for purpose such a spamming spreading misinformation or other objectionable end a a result of our prominence the size of our user base the type and volume of personal data and content on our system and the evolving nature of our product and service including our effort involving new and emerging technology we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breach and attack including from nation state and highly sophisticated statesponsored or otherwise wellfunded actor our effort to address undesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attack such breach and attack may cause interruption to the service we provide degrade the user experience cause user or marketer to lose confidence and trust in our product impair our internal system or result in financial harm to u our effort to protect our company data or the information we receive and to disable undesirable activity on our platform may also be unsuccessful due to software bug or other technical malfunction employee contractor or vendor error or malfeasance including defect or vulnerability in our vendor information technology system or offering government surveillance breach of physical security of our facility or technical infrastructure or other threat that evolve in addition third party may attempt to fraudulently induce employee or user to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our user data cyberattacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long period of time although we have developed system and process that are designed to protect our data and user data to prevent data loss to disable undesirable account and activity on our platform and to prevent or detect security breach we can not assure you that such measure will provide absolute security that we will be able to react in a timely manner or that our remediation effort will be successful in addition some of our developer or other partner such a those that help u measure the effectiveness of ad may receive or store information provided by u or by our user through mobile or web application integrated with facebook we provide limited information to such third party based on the scope of service provided to u however if these third party or developer fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practice or in the event of a breach of their network our data or our user data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed we experience such cyberattacks and other security incident of varying degree from time to time and we incur significant cost in protecting

under our modified consent order with the ftc a a result affected user or government authority could initiate legal or regulatory action against u in connection with any actual or perceived security breach or improper access to or disclosure of data table of content which ha occurred in the past and which could cause u to incur significant expense and liability or result in order or consent decree forcing u to modify our business practice such incident or our effort to remediate such incident may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement level any of these event could have a material and adverse effect on our business reputation or financial result for example in september we announced our discovery of a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access token which were then used to access certain profile information from approximately million user account on facebook the event surrounding this cyberattack became the subject of irish data protection commission and other government inquiry any such inquiry could subject u to substantial fine and cost require u to change our business practice divert resource and the attention of management from our business or adversely affect our business in addition the change in our work environment a a result of the covid pandemic could impact the security of our system a well a our ability to protect against attack and detect and respond to them quickly the rapid adoption of some thirdparty service designed to enable the transition to a remote workforce also may introduce security risk that is not fully mitigated prior to the use of these service we may also be subject to increased cyberattacks such a phishing attack by threat actor using the attention placed on the pandemic a a method for targeting our personnel we anticipate that our ongoing effort related to privacy safety security and content review will identify additional instance of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third party on our platform in addition to our effort to mitigate cybersecurity risk we are making significant investment in privacy safety security and content review effort to combat misuse of our service and user data by third party including investigation and audit of platform application a a result of these effort we have discovered and announced and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce additional incident of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third party we may not discover all such incident or activity whether a a result of our data or technical limitation including our lack of visibility over our encrypted service the scale of activity on our platform challenge related to our personnel working remotely during the covid pandemic the allocation of resource to other project or other factor and we may be notified of such incident or activity by the independent privacy assessor required under our modified consent order with the ftc the medium or other third party such incident and activity have in the past and may in the future include the use of user data or our system in a manner inconsistent with our term contract or policy the existence of false or undesirable user account election interference improper advertising practice activity that threaten people safety on or offline or instance of spamming scraping data harvesting unsecured datasets or spreading misinformation we may also be unsuccessful in our effort to enforce our policy or otherwise remediate any such incident any of the foregoing development may negatively affect user trust and engagement harm our reputation and brand require u to change our business practice in a manner adverse to our business and adversely affect our business and financial result any such development may also subject u to additional litigation and regulatory inquiry which could subject u to monetary penalty and damage divert management time and attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight our product and internal system rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and any error bug or vulnerability in these system or failure to address or mitigate technical limitation in our system could adversely affect our business our product and internal system rely on software and hardware including software and hardware developed or maintained internally andor by third party that is highly technical and complex in addition our product and internal system depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store retrieve process and manage immense amount of data the software and hardware on which we rely ha contained and will in the future contain error bug or vulnerability and our system are subject to certain technical limitation that may compromise our ability to meet our objective some error bug or vulnerability inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code ha been released for external or internal use for example in september we announced our discovery of a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access token and access certain profile information from user account on facebook error bug vulnerability design defect or technical limitation within the software and hardware on which we rely have in the past led to and may in the future lead to outcome including a negative experience for user and marketer who use our product compromised ability of our product to perform in a manner consistent with our term contract or policy delayed product introduction or enhancement targeting measurement or billing error compromised ability to protect the data of our user andor our intellectual property or other data or reduction in our ability to provide some or all of our service for example we make commitment to our user a to how their data will table of content be used within and across our product and our system are subject to error bug and technical limitation that may prevent u from fulfilling these commitment reliably in addition any error bug vulnerability or defect in our system or the software and hardware on which we rely failure to properly address or mitigate the technical limitation in our system or associated degradation or interruption of service or failure to fulfill our commitment to our user have in the past led to and may in the future lead to outcome including damage to our reputation loss of user loss of marketer loss of revenue regulatory inquiry litigation or liability for fine damage or other remedy any of which could adversely affect our business and financial result if we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brand and other intangible asset may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality assignment and license agreement with our employee consultant and third party with whom we have relationship a well a trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection law to protect our proprietary right in the united state and internationally we have filed various application for protection of certain aspect of our intellectual property and we currently hold a significant number of registered trademark and issued patent in multiple jurisdiction and have acquired patent and patent application from third party third party may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary right third party may challenge proprietary right held by u and pending and future trademark and patent application may not be approved in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business in any or all of these case we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our right although we have generally taken measure to protect our proprietary right there can be no assurance that others will not offer product or concept that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business in addition we regularly contribute software source code under open source license and have made other technology we developed available under other open license and we include open source software in our product a a result of our open source contribution and the use of open source in our product we may license or be required to license or disclose code andor innovation that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk if the protection of our proprietary right is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third party the value of our brand and other intangible asset may be diminished and competitor may be able to more effectively mimic our product service and method of operation any of these event could have an adverse effect on our business and financial result we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuit and other intellectual property right claim that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or result of operation company in the internet technology and medium industry own large number of patent copyright trademark and trade secret and frequently enter into litigation based on allegation of infringement misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property or other right in addition various non practicing entity that own patent and other intellectual property right often attempt to aggressively assert their right in order to extract value from technology company furthermore from time to time we may introduce or acquire new product including in area where we historically have not competed which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claim from competitor and nonpracticing entity from time to time we receive notice from patent holder and other party alleging that certain of our product and service or user content infringe their intellectual property right we presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuit and a we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claim against u to grow defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employee and there can be no assurance that favorable final outcome will be obtained in all case in addition plaintiff may seek and we may become subject to preliminary or provisional ruling in the course of any such litigation including potential preliminary injunction requiring u to cease some or all of our operation we may decide to settle such lawsuit and dispute on term that are unfavorable to u similarly if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal the term of such a settlement or judgment may require u to cease some or all of our operation or pay substantial amount to the other party in addition we may have to seek a license to continue practice found to be in violation of a third party right which may not be available on reasonable term or at all and may significantly increase our operating cost and expense a a result we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology or table of content practice or discontinue the practice the development of alternative noninfringing technology or practice could require significant effort and expense could result in le effective technology or practice or otherwise negatively affect the user experience or may not be feasible we have experienced unfavorable outcome in such dispute and litigation in the past and our business financial condition and result of operation could be adversely affected a a result of an unfavorable resolution of the dispute and litigation referred to above

marketer use our product to connect with consumer where they are and ii making our ad more relevant and effective our business ha been impacted by the covid pandemic which ha resulted in authority implementing numerous preventative measure to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus such a travel ban and restriction limitation on business activity quarantine and shelterinplace order these measure have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdown or shutdown in affected area both regionally and worldwide which have significantly impacted our business and result of operation beginning in the first quarter of we experienced significant increase in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of region a a result of the covid pandemic more recently we have seen user growth and engagement returning to prepandemic trend particularly in the united state canada region we are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty and we expect these trend to continue to be subject to volatility the covid pandemic ha also previously caused a reduction in the demand for advertising a well a a related decline in the pricing of our ad particularly in the second quarter of more recently we believe the pandemic ha contributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce from offline to online a well a increasing consumer demand for purchasing product a opposed to service and we experienced increasing demand for advertising a a result of these trend however it is possible that this increased demand may not continue in future period and may even recede a the effect of the pandemic subside which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement the demand for and pricing of our advertising service a well a on our overall result of operation remains highly uncertain for the foreseeable future in addition we expect that future advertising revenue growth will continue to be adversely affected by limitation on our ad targeting and measurement tool arising from change to the regulatory environment and thirdparty mobile operating system and browser we intend to continue to invest in our business based on our company priority and we anticipate that additional investment in our data center capacity server network infrastructure and office facility a well a scaling our headcount to support our growth will continue to drive expense growth in we expect capital expenditure to be in the range of billion and total

the same period in table of content trend in our monetization by facebook user geography we calculate our revenue by facebook user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impression are delivered virtual and digital good are purchased or consumer hardware device are shipped we define arpu a our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter while arpu includes all source of revenue the number of maus used in this calculation only includes user of facebook and messenger a described in the definition of mau above the share of revenue from user who are not also facebook or messenger maus wa not material the geography of our user affect our revenue and financial result because we currently monetize user in different geography at different average rate our revenue and arpu in region such a united state canada and europe are relatively

apportioned based on the billing address of the customer table of content our annual worldwide arpu in which represents the sum of quarterly arpu during such period wa an increase of from over this period arpu increased by in the united state canada in europe and in asia‑pacific and arpu wa flat in rest of world in addition user growth wa more rapid in geography with relatively lower arpu such a asia‑pacific and rest of world we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those region where arpu is relatively lower such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if arpu increase in each geographic region table of content trend in our family metric the number for our key

of content critical accounting policy and estimate our consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with u gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statement requires u to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue cost and expense and related disclosure on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimate and assumption based on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance our actual result could differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matter or the susceptibility of such matter to change and the impact of the estimate and assumption on our consolidated financial statement is material we believe that the assumption and estimate associated with gross v net in revenue recognition valuation of equity investment income tax loss contingency valuation of longlived asset including goodwill and intangible asset and their associated estimated useful life have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statement therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policy and estimate for further information on all of our significant accounting policy see note —summary of significant accounting policy in the accompanying note to consolidated financial statement included in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data of this annual report on form k in response to the economic slowdown caused by the covid pandemic we believe that the assumption and estimate associated with collectibility assessment of revenue and credit loss of account receivable could have a material impact to our consolidated financial statement in future period depending on the duration or degree of the impact of the covid pandemic on the global economy collectibility assessment of revenue under topic we recognize revenue using a fivestep model in step one for a revenue contract to exist it must be probable that substantially all of the consideration to which we are entitled to will be collected in performing such collectibility assessment we consider various fact and circumstance including future expectation about our customer ability and intention to pay collectibility assessment us a probable threshold which requires estimation based on several objective and subjective factor such a probability of default customer ’ s intention to pay payment history financial strength geography and industry sub vertical risk the collectibility assessment ha become uncertain during the current economic environment caused by the covid pandemic and our actual experience in the future may differ from our past experience or current assessment credit loss of account receivable on january we adopted accounting standard update no financial instrumentscredit loss topic measurement of credit loss on financial instrument which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit loss for financial asset held at amortized cost that an entity doe not expect to collect over the asset contractual life considering past event current condition and reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic condition for account receivable measured at amortized cost we use aging analysis probability of default method and incorporate macroeconomic variable that are most relevant to evaluating and estimating the expected credit loss these macroeconomic variable may vary by geography customertype or industry sub vertical the contractual life of our trade account receivable is generally shortterm however we may experience increasing credit loss risk from account receivable in future period depending on the duration or degree of economic slowdown caused by the covid pandemic and our actual experience in the future may differ from our past experience or current assessment gross v net in revenue recognition for revenue generated from arrangement that involve thirdparty publisher there is significant judgment in evaluating whether we are the principal and report revenue on a gross basis or the agent and report revenue on a net basis in this assessment we consider if we obtain control of the specified good or service before they are transferred to the customer a well a other indicator such a the party primarily responsible for fulfillment inventory risk and discretion in table of content establishing price the assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenue recognized on the consolidated statement of income valuation of equity investment for our equity security without readily determinable fair value accounted for using the measurement alternative determining whether an equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the equity security we hold may require judgment in a assessment of difference in right and obligation associated with the instrument such a voting right distribution right and preference and conversion feature and b adjustment to the observable price for difference such a but not limited to right and obligation control premium liquidity or principal or most advantageous market in addition the identification of observable transaction will depend on the timely reporting of these transaction from our investee company which may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction take place therefore our fair value adjustment for these observable transaction may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred for equity investment we perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering event for impairment the qualitative assessment considers factor such a but not limited to the investees financial condition and business outlook industry and sector performance regulatory economic or technological environment operational and financing cash flow and other relevant event and factor affecting the investee when indicator of impairment exist we estimate the fair value of our equity investment using the market approach andor the income approach and recognize impairment loss in the consolidated statement of income if the estimated fair value is le than the carrying value estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimate such a discount rate forecast cash flow holding period and market data of comparable company among others income tax we are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax and income tax asset and liability including evaluating uncertainty in the application of accounting principle and complex tax law we recognize tax benefit from uncertain tax position only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position these uncertain tax position include our estimate for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analysis of appropriate armslength price similarly our estimate related to uncertain tax position concerning research tax credit are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activity supporting the tax credit will be sufficient although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax position including net interest and penalty we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matter will not be materially different we make adjustment to these reserve in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when fact and circumstance change such a the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matter is different from the amount recorded such difference will affect the provision for income tax in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating result loss contingency we are involved in legal proceeding claim and regulatory tax or government inquiry and investigation that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matter include speculative claim for substantial or indeterminate amount of damage additionally we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligation around the world the requirement for complying with these obligation may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authority and any failure to comply with such obligation could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action with respect to these matter asserted and unasserted we evaluate the associated development on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying note to the consolidated financial statement to the extent material we review the development in our contingency that could affect the amount of the provision that have been previously recorded and the matter and related reasonably possible loss disclosed we make adjustment to our provision and change to our disclosure accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiation settlement ruling advice of legal counsel table of content and updated information significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss including when and if the probability and estimate ha changed for asserted and unasserted matter the ultimate outcome of these matter such a whether the likelihood of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these matter were resolved against u for amount in excess of management estimate of loss our result of operation and financial condition including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable could be materially adversely affected see note —commitments and contingency and note —income tax of the accompanying note to our consolidated financial statement included in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data and part i item legal proceeding of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding these contingency valuation of longlived asset including goodwill intangible asset and estimated useful life we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible asset acquired liability assumed and intangible asset acquired based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable asset and liability is recorded a goodwill such valuation require management to make significant estimate and assumption especially with respect to intangible asset significant estimate in valuing certain intangible asset include but are not limited to estimated replacement cost and future expected cash flow from acquired user acquired technology acquired patent and trade name from a market participant perspective useful life and discount rate management estimate of fair value are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and a a result actual result may differ from estimate allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable asset and liability affect our amortization expense a acquired finitelived intangible asset are amortized over the useful life whereas any indefinite lived intangible asset including goodwill are not amortized during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustment are recorded to earnings we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if event or change in circumstance would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below it carrying value a of december no impairment of goodwill ha been identified longlived asset including property and equipment and intangible asset are reviewed for possible impairment whenever event or circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other asset and liability recoverability of these asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flow the asset are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible asset is not recoverable the carrying amount of such asset is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment charge during the year presented the useful life of our longlived asset including property and equipment and finitelived intangible asset are determined by management when those asset are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful life the current estimate of useful life represents our best estimate based on current fact and circumstance but may differ from the actual useful life due to change in future circumstance such a change to our business operation change in the planned use of asset and technological advancement when we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life historically change in useful life have not resulted in material change to our depreciation and amortization expense table of content component of result of operation revenue advertising we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad product on facebook instagram messenger and thirdparty affiliated website or mobile application marketer pay for ad product either directly or through their relationship with advertising

ended december v change v change in million advertising other revenue total revenue compared to revenue in increased billion or compared to the increase wa mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue a a result of an increase in the number of ad delivered partially offset by a decrease in the average price per ad in the number of ad delivered increased by a compared with approximately in the increase in the ad delivered wa driven by an increase in the number and frequency of ad displayed across our product and an increase in user in the average price per ad decreased by a compared with a decrease of approximately in the decrease in average price per ad during the year ended december wa primarily driven by a decrease in advertising demand globally during the first two quarter of due to the covid pandemic and to a lesser extent by an increasing proportion of the number of ad delivered a story ad and in geography that monetize at lower rate in the nearterm we anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be determined primarily by several factor the extent to which we continue to see increasing advertising demand in connection with the shift of commerce from offline to online a well a increased consumer demand for purchasing product a opposed to service a a result of the covid pandemic the status of the economic recovery from the slowdown caused by the covid pandemic and the magnitude of fiscal stimulus and the extent to which change to the regulatory environment and thirdparty mobile operating system and browser result in limitation on our ad targeting and measurement tool advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year we believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affect our quarterly result which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarter and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarter for instance our advertising revenue increased and between the third and fourth quarter of and respectively while advertising revenue for both the first quarter of and declined and compared to the fourth quarter of and respectively no customer represented or more of total revenue during the year ended december and foreign exchange impact on revenue the general strengthening of the u dollar relative to

consumer hardware device sold in we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase a we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth increased

ended december v change v change dollar in million research and development percentage of revenue compared to research and development expense in increased billion or compared to the increase wa

that wa not taxdeductible the additional tax expense incurred in from the altera ninth circuit opinion and the effect of a tax election to capitalize and amortize certain research and development expense for u income tax purpose in the third quarter of a part of finalizing our u income tax return we elected to capitalize and amortize certain research and development expense for u income tax purpose a a result we recorded a total of billion table of content income tax benefit for the year ended december the income tax benefit resulted from recording a deferred income tax asset that wa greater than the current income tax liability due to different tax rate applicable for the period in which capitalized expense will be amortized versus the period in which the increased current tax liability wa accrued we do not believe this election will materially affect our effective tax rate trend in the future on july the united state tax court issued a decision tax court decision in altera corp v commissioner which concluded that related party in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expense related to sharebased compensation the tax court decision wa appealed by the commissioner to the ninth circuit court of appeal ninth circuit on june the ninth circuit issued an opinion altera ninth circuit opinion that reversed the tax court decision based on the altera ninth circuit opinion we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of billion in the second quarter of on july the taxpayer requested a rehearing before the full ninth circuit and the request wa denied on november the taxpayer requested a hearing before the supreme court of the united state and the request wa denied on june since we started to accrue income tax for sharebased compensation costsharing expense in the second quarter of the denial of the request by the supreme court did not have a material impact to our financial result in effective tax rate item our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following item and income before provision for income tax u tax benefit from foreign derived intangible income tax effect from sharebased compensation tax effect of integrating intellectual property from acquisition settlement of tax contingency item tax effect of change in our business and the effect of change in tax law the accounting for sharebased compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our sharebased compensation expense and the deduction taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting if our stock price remains constant to the january price we expect our effective tax rate for the full year of will be in the highteens integrating intellectual property from acquisition into our business generally involves intercompany transaction that have the impact of increasing our provision for income tax consequently our provision for income tax and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration the magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type size and taxing jurisdiction of the intellectual property a well a the relative contribution to income in subsequent period unrecognized tax benefit a of december we had net unrecognized tax benefit of billion which were accrued a other liability these unrecognized tax benefit were predominantly accrued for uncertainty related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiary which includes licensing of intellectual property providing service and other transaction a well a for uncertainty with our research tax credit the ultimate settlement of the liability will depend upon resolution of tax audit litigation or event that would otherwise change the assessment of such item based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audit in various jurisdiction we do not anticipate a material change to such amount within the next month in july we received a statutory notice of deficiency notice from the irs related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiary in conjunction with the examination of the tax year while the notice applies only to the tax year the irs stated that it will also apply it position for tax year subsequent to we do not agree with the position of the irs and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the notice on january the irs filed it pretrial memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the notice the first session of the trial began in february and additional session are expected to continue in the irs did not provide any information about how it intends to apply the revised adjustment to future year based on the information provided we believe that if the irs prevails in it updated position this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated aggregate amount of up to approximately billion in excess of the amount in our originally filed u return plus interest and any penalty asserted in march we received a second notice from the irs in conjunction with the examination of our through tax year the irs applied it position from the tax year to each of these year and also proposed new adjustment related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiary and certain tax credit that we claimed if the irs prevails in it position for these new adjustment this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately million table of content in excess of the amount in our originally filed u return plus interest and any penalty asserted we do not agree with the position of the irs in the second notice and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the second notice we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc income tax that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the position taken by the irs in the two notice and it pretrial memorandum in addition if the irs

transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the tax cut and job act tax act a of december we have not resolved these matter and proceeding continue in the tax court we believe that adequate amount have been reserved in accordance with asc income tax for any adjustment to the provision for income tax or other tax item that may ultimately result from these examination the timing of the resolution settlement and closure of any audit is highly uncertain and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefit could significantly change in the next month given the number of year remaining that are subject to examination in various jurisdiction we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustment to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefit if

change a new event occur and additional information emerges and such change are recognized or disclosed in our consolidated financial statement revenue recognition revenue is recognized when control of the promised good or service is transferred to our customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those good or service we determine revenue recognition by applying the following step • identification of the contract or contract with a customer • identification of the performance obligation in the contract • determination of the transaction price • allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract and • recognition of revenue when or a we satisfy a performance obligation revenue excludes sale

the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customer for revenue generated from arrangement that involve thirdparty publisher we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent and for those advertising revenue arrangement where we are the agent we recognize revenue on a net basis we may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transaction and certain customer may receive cash based incentive credit or refund which are accounted for a variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize we estimate these amount based on the expected amount to be provided to customer and reduce revenue we believe that there will not be significant change to our estimate of variable consideration other revenue other revenue consists of revenue from the delivery of facebook reality lab frl consumer hardware device net fee we receive from developer using our payment infrastructure a well a revenue from various other source deferred revenue and deposit deferred revenue mostly consists of billing and payment we receive from marketer in advance of revenue recognition a well a revenue not yet recognized for unspecified software upgrade and update for various frl product deposit relate to unused balance held on behalf of our user who primarily use these balance to make purchase in game on our platform once this balance is utilized by a user the majority of this amount would then be payable to the developer and the balance would be recognized a revenue the increase in the deferred revenue balance for the year ended december wa driven by cash payment from customer in advance of satisfying our performance obligation in frl sale and advertising revenue offset by revenue recognized that wa included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period our payment term vary by the product or service offered the term between billing and when payment is due is not significant for certain product or service and customer type we require payment before the product or service are delivered to the customer practical expedient and exemption we generally expense sale commission when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or le these cost are recorded within marketing and sale on our consolidated statement of income we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligation for i contract with an original expected length of one year or le and ii contract for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for service performed cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists primarily of expense associated with the delivery and distribution of our product these include expense related to the operation of our data center and technical infrastructure such a facility and server equipment depreciation salary benefit and sharebased compensation for employee on our operation team and energy and bandwidth cost cost of revenue also includes cost associated with partner arrangement including traffic acquisition table of content and content cost credit card and other transaction fee related to processing customer transaction and cost of consumer hardware device sold content cost our content cost are mostly related to payment to content provider from whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform for licensed video we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available for viewing if the capitalization criterion are not met video content cost that meet the criterion for capitalization were not material to date for licensed music we expense the license fee over the contractual license period expensed content cost are included in cost of revenue on the consolidated statement of income software development cost software development cost including cost to develop software product or the software component of product to be marketed or sold to external user are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility which is typically reached shortly before the release of such product software development cost also include cost to develop software to be used solely to meet internal need and application used to deliver our service these software development cost meet the criterion for capitalization once the

income tax and income tax asset and liability including evaluating uncertainty in the application of accounting principle and complex tax law we record a provision for income tax for the anticipated tax consequence of the reported result of operation using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred income tax asset and liability for the expected future consequence of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability a well a for loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax asset and liability are measured using the tax rate that are expected to apply to taxable income for the year in which those tax asset and liability are expected to be realized or settled we recognize the deferred income tax effect of a change in tax rate in the period of the enactment we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical level of income expectation and risk associated with estimate of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategy in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we recognize tax benefit from uncertain tax position only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position these uncertain tax position include our estimate for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analysis of appropriate armslength price similarly our estimate related to uncertain tax position concerning research tax credit are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activity

observable transaction for identical or similar investment of the same issuer the change in carrying value if any is recognized in interest and other income expense net on our consolidated statement of income we periodically review our equity investment for impairment if indicator exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below the carrying amount we will write down the investment to fair value in addition we also held equity investment accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial a of december and equity investment had a carrying value of billion and million a of december and respectively there wa no material impairment in and fair value of financial instrument we apply fair value accounting for all financial asset and liability and nonfinancial asset and liability that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statement on a recurring basis we define fair value a the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurement for asset and liability which are required to be recorded at fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the marketbased risk measurement or assumption that market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability such a risk inherent in valuation technique transfer restriction and credit risk fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the input used to measure fair value into three level and base the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement level quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability table of content level observable input other than quoted price in active market for identical asset and liability quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in inactive market or other input that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability level input that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management estimate of assumption that market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability our valuation technique used to measure the fair value of cash equivalent and marketable debt security were derived from quoted market price or alternative pricing source and model utilizing observable market input account receivable and allowance account receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount le an allowance for any potential uncollectible amount we make estimate of expected credit and collectibility trend for the

from the actual useful life due to change in future circumstance such a change to our business operation change in the planned use of asset and technological advancement when we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life historically change

such asset may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other asset and liability recoverability of these asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flow the asset are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible asset is not recoverable the carrying amount of such asset is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment

commission idpc and other government inquiry from time to time we also notify the idpc our designated european privacy regulator under the general data protection regulation of certain other personal data breach and privacy issue and are subject to inquiry and investigation regarding various aspect of our regulatory compliance although we are vigorously defending our regulatory compliance we believe there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate potential loss related to the inquiry and investigation by the idpc could be material in the aggregate in addition from time to time we are subject to litigation and other proceeding involving law enforcement and other regulatory agency including in particular in brazil and europe in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligation to comply with the request of those agency including our obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstance a number of such instance have resulted in the assessment of fine

content with respect to the case action and inquiry described above we evaluate the associated development on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in addition we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these matter with respect to the matter described above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible loss such loss or range of possible loss either can not be estimated or are not individually material but we believe there is a reasonable possibility that they may be material in the aggregate we are also party to various other legal proceeding claim and regulatory tax or government inquiry and investigation that arise in the ordinary course of business for example from time to time we are subject to various litigation and government inquiry and investigation formal or informal by competition authority in the united state europe

whatsapp multiple putative class action have also been filed in state and federal court in the united state against u alleging violation of antitrust law and other cause of action in connection with these acquisition and other alleged anticompetitive conduct and seeking unspecified damage and injunctive relief we believe these lawsuit are without merit and we are vigorously defending them additionally we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligation around the world the requirement for complying with these obligation may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authority and any failure to comply with such obligation could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action with respect to these other legal proceeding claim regulatory tax or government inquiry and investigation and other matter asserted and unasserted we evaluate the associated development on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in addition we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these other matter we believe that the amount of loss or any estimable range of possible loss with respect to these other matter will not either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statement the ultimate outcome of the legal and related matter described in this section such a whether the likelihood of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these matter were resolved against u for amount in excess of management estimate of loss our result of operation and financial condition including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable could be materially adversely affected for information regarding income tax contingency see note —income tax table of content indemnification in the normal course of business to facilitate transaction of service and product we have agreed to

expense in the second quarter of the denial of the request by the supreme court did not have a material impact to our financial result in we are subject to taxation in the united state and various other state and foreign jurisdiction the material jurisdiction in which we are subject to potential examination include the united state and ireland we are under examination by the internal revenue service irs for our through and tax year and by the irish tax authority for our through tax year our and subsequent tax year remain open to examination by the irs our and subsequent tax year remain open to examination in ireland in july we received a statutory notice of deficiency notice from the irs related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiary in conjunction with the examination of the tax year while the notice applies only to the tax year the irs stated that it will also apply it position for tax year subsequent to we do not agree with the position of the irs and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the notice on january the irs filed it pretrial memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the notice the first session of the trial began in february and a second session is expected to continue in it is not clear how the irs intends to apply the revised adjustment to future year based on the information provided we believe that if the irs prevails in it updated position this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated aggregate amount of up to approximately billion in excess of the amount in our originally filed u return plus interest and any penalty asserted in march we received a second notice from the irs in conjunction with the examination of our through tax year the irs applied it position from the tax year to each of these year and also proposed new adjustment related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiary and certain tax credit that we claimed if the irs prevails in it position for these new adjustment this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately million in excess of the amount in our originally filed u return plus interest and any penalty asserted we do not agree with the position of the irs in the second notice and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the second notice we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc income tax that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the position taken by the irs in the two notice and it pretrial memorandum in addition if the irs prevails in it position related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiary the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the tax cut and job act tax act a of december we have not resolved these matter and proceeding continue in the tax court we believe that adequate amount have been reserved in accordance with asc for any adjustment to the provision for income tax or other tax item that may ultimately result from these examination the timing of the resolution settlement and closure of any audit is highly uncertain and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefit could significantly change in the next month given the number of year remaining that are subject to examination we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustment to the balance of gross unrecognized table of content tax benefit if the taxing authority prevail in the assessment of additional tax due the assessed tax interest and
